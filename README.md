2. **Develop an AML/CTF program** tailored to your firm's risks
3. **Conduct customer due diligence** before providing designated services
4. **Monitor customers** throughout the relationship
5. **Report suspicious matters** to AUSTRAC (within 3 days for ML, 24 hours for TF)
6. **Report cash transactions** of $10,000+ (within 10 business days)
7. **Keep records** for 7 years
8. **Submit annual compliance reports** to AUSTRAC
