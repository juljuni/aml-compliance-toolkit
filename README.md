# AML Compliance Toolkit for Small Accounting Firms
# AML Compliance Toolkit for Small Accounting Firms

## Problem
Australian accounting firms must comply with AML/CTF regulations by July 1, 2026.
Small firms (3-10 staff) struggling with compliance burden.

## Opportunity
Automate client onboarding, risk assessment, documentation, ongoing monitoring.

## Revenue Model
- Setup: $2k-10k per firm
- Recurring: $200-750/month
- Target: 10 firms = $110k first year

## Status
Research phase - meeting with accountant in 5 days

## Research Completed

Comprehensive research materials now available in `/research/`:

### 1. Compliance Requirements Document
**File:** `research/01-aml-compliance-requirements.md`

Complete guide covering:
- What triggers AML obligations for accountants
- Registration deadlines (March 31, 2026)
- Customer due diligence requirements
- Evidence and documentation needed
- Ongoing monitoring frequency and triggers
- Record keeping requirements (7 years)
- Penalties for non-compliance (up to $37.8M for serious breaches)
- Implementation timeline and checklist

**Key Finding:** Designated services include assisting with company/trust formation, business entity sales, and real estate transactions - NOT simple tax returns or bookkeeping.

### 2. Solutions Comparison Table
**File:** `research/02-aml-solutions-comparison.md`

Analysis of available compliance solutions:

**FREE Options:**
- AUSTRAC Accounting Program Starter Kit (developed by Grant Thornton)
- Professional body resources (CPA, CA ANZ, IPA)

**Commercial Options:**
- IRIS AML Software (£320+/~$620+, accounting-specific)
- Grant Thornton AUSTRAC Starter Program (enterprise, quote-based)
- First AML (AU/NZ focused)
- Electronic verification services ($2-10/check)

**Recommendations by Firm Size:**
- 1-5 staff: FREE starter kit ($0-$500/year)
- 5-15 staff: Starter kit + eVerification ($1,000-$3,000/year)
- 15-30 staff: Commercial software ($3,000-$10,000/year)
- 30+ staff: Enterprise solution ($10,000-$50,000+/year)

**Key Finding:** Automation break-even point is ~67 clients/year - firms with 70+ designated service clients justify software investment.

### 3. Client Onboarding Workflow
**File:** `research/03-client-onboarding-workflow.md`

Detailed workflow showing EVERY step where AML creates work:

**Time Impact Per Client:**
- Simple case: 2-3.5 hours initial onboarding
- Complex case: 5-10+ hours initial onboarding
- Ongoing reviews: 20 minutes - 2 hours (based on risk rating)

**Major AML Touchpoints:**
1. Service determination (is it designated?)
2. Customer due diligence (identity verification)
3. Beneficial ownership identification (25%+ owners)
4. PEP screening (politically exposed persons)
5. Sanctions & adverse media screening
6. Risk assessment and rating
7. Senior management approval (high-risk clients)
8. Ongoing monitoring (1-5 year frequency)
9. Suspicious matter reporting (if needed)
10. 7-year record retention

**Cost Example - Small Firm (30 clients/year):**
- First year: $13,500 (setup + onboarding + transitions)
- Subsequent years: $6,000/year (ongoing)

## Automation Opportunities Identified

Based on the research, high-value automation targets:

1. **Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Automation**
   - Electronic ID verification (vs. manual document checks)
   - Saves 10-20 minutes per client
   - Current solutions: $2-10/check (no integrated solution for small firms)

2. **Risk Assessment Automation**
   - Automated risk scoring based on questionnaire
   - PEP/sanctions screening integration
   - Saves 20-40 minutes per client
   - Current gap: Most tools don't auto-score for accountants

3. **Ongoing Monitoring Reminders**
   - Auto-schedule OCDD reviews based on risk rating
   - Alert when review due (1-5 year cycles)
   - Saves missed reviews, reduces compliance risk
   - Current gap: Practice management systems don't have AML-specific triggers

4. **Document Management**
   - Centralized AML file with 7-year retention
   - Audit-ready documentation
   - Saves 15-30 minutes per client
   - Current gap: No accounting-specific AML document vault

5. **Form Generation & Workflow**
   - Pre-fill client forms from practice management
   - Workflow management (incomplete CDD = block service)
   - Saves 20-30 minutes per client
   - Current gap: Manual form handling in most solutions

**Total Time Savings Potential:** 65-120 minutes per client (vs. manual AUSTRAC starter kit)

**Market Gap:** Commercial solutions are enterprise-focused ($5k-$50k+). Small firms (1-15 staff) underserved - they need affordable automation (~$200-750/month range).

## Next Steps
1. ~~Research AML/CTF Act 2024 requirements~~ ✓ DONE
2. Validate with 3-5 small firms (use research materials in meeting)
3. Map automation opportunities → **Focus on CDD + risk assessment + OCDD reminders**
4. Build MVP if validated

## Meeting Preparation

**Meeting Context:** Consulting with YOUR accountant as an industry expert (not a potential customer)

3. Is 2-10 hours per client realistic or conservative?
