# AML/CTF Compliance Overview for Australian Accounting Firms

## What is AML/CTF Compliance

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) compliance refers to the legal framework designed to detect, deter, and prevent the use of Australia's financial system for money laundering and terrorism financing activities. Money laundering is the process of disguising the proceeds of crime as legitimate funds, while terrorism financing involves providing financial support to terrorist activities or organizations.

The AML/CTF regime requires certain businesses—known as "reporting entities"—to implement systems and controls that help identify suspicious activities, verify customer identities, assess risks, and report certain transactions to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), Australia's financial intelligence agency and AML/CTF regulator.

These obligations are built on a risk-based approach, meaning businesses must understand their specific exposure to money laundering and terrorism financing threats, then implement controls proportionate to those risks. The core principle is "know your customer" (KYC)—understanding who you're doing business with and whether their activities appear legitimate.

## Why Accounting Firms Are Now Included

For nearly two decades since the AML/CTF Act commenced in 2006, accounting firms operated outside the regulatory framework. The regime initially focused on financial institutions like banks, casinos, remittance providers, and bullion dealers. However, international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)—the global AML/CTF standard-setter—have long identified certain professional services as high-risk for money laundering.

Accountants, lawyers, real estate agents, and trust and company service providers, collectively known as "Tranche 2" entities, have been recognized as vulnerable to exploitation by criminals seeking to legitimize illicit funds. Criminals often use these professionals to:

- Establish complex corporate structures that obscure beneficial ownership
- Create trusts to hide assets and control
- Purchase high-value assets like property to integrate dirty money into the legitimate economy
- Access financial systems through legitimate-looking business arrangements
- Obtain professional credentials and legitimacy for criminal enterprises

Australia has faced international pressure to extend its AML/CTF regime to these professions. The delay in regulating Tranche 2 entities had been criticized as a gap in Australia's financial crime defenses, potentially making the country an attractive destination for money launderers compared to jurisdictions with more comprehensive coverage.

The [Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Act 2024](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7243) passed Parliament on November 29, 2024, representing the most transformational changes to Australia's AML/CTF framework since its inception. This reform brings Australian legislation into closer alignment with international best practices and addresses long-standing vulnerabilities in the system.

## The July 2026 Deadline and What Triggered It

The legislation establishes a phased implementation timeline to allow newly regulated businesses time to prepare:

**March 31, 2026**: Enrolment with AUSTRAC opens for Tranche 2 entities. Accounting firms cannot enrol before this date, regardless of their readiness.

**July 1, 2026**: Full compliance obligations commence. From this date, accounting firms must have their AML/CTF programs operational before providing any designated services to clients.

This timeline reflects a balance between regulatory urgency and practical implementation challenges. The government recognizes that professional service providers need time to:

- Understand their new obligations
- Develop policies and procedures
- Implement technology systems
- Train staff
- Conduct initial risk assessments
- Prepare documentation

The July 2026 deadline is absolute. Unlike some regulatory changes that allow grace periods, firms providing designated services after this date without proper AML/CTF programs in place face immediate enforcement risk, including substantial daily penalties for failure to enroll with AUSTRAC.

What triggered this specific timeline was the passage of the Amendment Act in late 2024, providing approximately 18 months from enactment to compliance commencement. This period was deemed the minimum necessary for industry preparation while not unduly delaying the closure of a significant regulatory gap that has existed for years.

## Which Firms Are Affected

Not all accounting firms are automatically subject to AML/CTF obligations. The regulations are service-based rather than profession-based—meaning compliance requirements are triggered when specific "designated services" are provided, regardless of firm size.

### Designated Services for Accountants

Accounting firms become reporting entities when they provide these designated services:

**Trust and Company Services**: Creating, managing, or acting as a trustee for trusts, or forming or managing companies, partnerships, or associations. This includes:
- Establishing discretionary trusts for estate planning or asset protection
- Setting up family trusts
- Acting as corporate trustees
- Managing self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) structures when they involve trust arrangements
- Incorporating companies on behalf of clients

**ASIC Agent Services**: Acting as an agent for clients in dealings with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), such as:
- Lodging company incorporation documents
- Registering business names
- Filing annual returns and other ASIC documents on behalf of clients

**High-Value Financial Services**: Services involving the preparation, arrangement, or conduct of transactions concerning buying, selling, or transferring real property, business entities, or financial products when the threshold amount (A$10,000 or more in physical currency) is met.

### Services NOT Subject to AML/CTF Requirements

Importantly, many traditional accounting services remain outside the AML/CTF framework, including:
- Tax return preparation and lodgment
- BAS and activity statement preparation
- General bookkeeping and accounting services
- Financial statement preparation and auditing
- Management accounting and advisory services
- Most SMSF administration (except when establishing trust structures)

This means a small tax practice that only prepares tax returns and BAS statements would not be a reporting entity, while a firm that also establishes family trusts or incorporates companies for clients would be captured.

### Firm Size Considerations

There are no firm size exemptions. A sole practitioner providing designated services has the same obligations as a large national firm. However, the AML/CTF Act requires programs to be proportionate to the business's size, nature, and complexity. This means:

- **Sole practitioners and small firms** can develop simpler, streamlined programs appropriate to their limited service offerings and lower transaction volumes
- **Medium firms** with multiple service lines need more comprehensive programs covering different risk profiles
- **Large firms** require sophisticated programs with dedicated compliance resources, advanced technology, and complex governance structures

### Pre-Commencement Clients

One significant concession addresses the practical challenge of onboarding existing client bases. Clients who engaged the firm before July 1, 2026 (pre-commencement customers) do not require immediate customer due diligence. However, if these existing clients request new designated services after July 1, 2026, or if their circumstances change in ways that elevate risk to medium or high levels, full customer identification and verification becomes mandatory.

This means an accounting firm with 500 existing clients on June 30, 2026 doesn't need to immediately verify all 500 clients' identities. But if on August 15, 2026, one of those clients asks the firm to establish a new trust, the firm must complete full customer due diligence before providing that designated service.

## Practical Implications

The inclusion of accounting firms fundamentally changes the compliance landscape for the profession. Firms must now balance their traditional role as trusted advisors with new responsibilities as gatekeepers against financial crime. This involves:

- **Cultural shift**: Moving from a purely client-service mindset to incorporating regulatory oversight and risk management
- **Operational changes**: Implementing new processes, systems, and controls that may slow client onboarding and service delivery
- **Resource allocation**: Dedicating staff time and financial resources to compliance activities
- **Ongoing education**: Keeping current with evolving threats, regulatory guidance, and enforcement expectations
- **Technology investment**: Adopting software solutions to manage verification, monitoring, and reporting obligations efficiently

The firms most affected will be those offering business structuring advice, estate planning, and company formation services—areas where designated services are commonly provided. Firms positioned primarily as tax compliance specialists may find their exposure more limited, though they should carefully review their service offerings to identify any potential triggers for AML/CTF obligations.
