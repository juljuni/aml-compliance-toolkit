# Penalties and Enforcement for AML/CTF Non-Compliance

## Civil Penalties

The AML/CTF Act establishes a civil penalty regime that allows AUSTRAC to seek court orders requiring firms or individuals to pay substantial financial penalties for breaches. Civil penalties do not require proof of criminal intent—strict liability applies to many obligations, meaning even inadvertent breaches can attract penalties.

### Maximum Civil Penalty Amounts

**For Body Corporates (Companies and Firms)**:
- Maximum: **100,000 penalty units** per contravention
- Current penalty unit value: $313 (as of 2024-2025)
- Maximum fine per contravention: **$31,300,000**

**For Individuals (Sole Practitioners, Partners, Directors, Compliance Officers)**:
- Maximum: **20,000 penalty units** per contravention
- Maximum fine per contravention: **$6,260,000**

These are maximum amounts. Courts determine actual penalties based on:
- Seriousness of the breach
- Duration and frequency of non-compliance
- Whether the breach was deliberate, reckless, or inadvertent
- Prior compliance history
- Size and resources of the firm
- Degree of cooperation with AUSTRAC
- Steps taken to remedy the breach once identified
- Harm or potential harm caused by the breach

### What Constitutes a Contravention

Each instance of non-compliance is a separate contravention. This can result in astronomical penalties for systemic or repeated failures.

**Examples**:

*Example 1 - Multiple Customer Identification Failures*:
Firm provides designated services to 50 new customers without conducting customer due diligence. This constitutes 50 separate contraventions, each potentially attracting civil penalties. Maximum theoretical penalty: $1,565,000,000 (50 × $31.3M), though actual penalties would be far lower based on proportionality and other factors.

*Example 2 - Westpac Case*:
On October 21, 2020, the Federal Court declared that Westpac breached the AML/CTF Act on **over 19 million occasions** and ordered Westpac to pay a **$1.3 billion penalty**—the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history. The contraventions included:
- Failing to report over 19 million international funds transfer instructions (IFTIs) to AUSTRAC
- Failing to conduct appropriate customer due diligence on transactions to the Philippines and Southeast Asia that were potentially related to child exploitation
- Failing to adequately assess and monitor ongoing money laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with movement of funds into and out of Australia

*Example 3 - Commonwealth Bank Case*:
On June 20, 2018, the Federal Court ordered Commonwealth Bank to pay a **$700 million penalty** for serious and systemic non-compliance, including:
- Late reporting of threshold transactions
- Failures in customer due diligence
- Inadequate monitoring of customer accounts

*Example 4 - Crown Resorts Case*:
On July 11, 2023, the Federal Court ordered Crown Resorts to pay a **$450 million penalty** for AML/CTF breaches including:
- Failure to have appropriate systems and controls in place for managing customers, including those linked to organized crime and foreign criminal organizations
- Inadequate ongoing customer due diligence
- Failures in assessing and managing risks associated with high-risk customers

### Civil Penalties by Obligation Type

**Failure to Enrol with AUSTRAC**:
- **Daily penalties**: $18,780 per day for firms; $3,756 per day for individuals
- These penalties accrue for each day designated services are provided without enrolment
- Example: Firm provides designated services from July 1, 2026 without enrolling. By December 31, 2026 (183 days), penalties have accrued to $3,436,740 ($18,780 × 183 days)

**Failure to Have an AML/CTF Program**:
- Civil penalty up to $31.3M for firms; $6.26M for individuals
- Each day of operation without a compliant program can be treated as a separate contravention

**Failure to Conduct Customer Due Diligence**:
- Civil penalty up to $31.3M for firms; $6.26M for individuals per customer
- Applies when designated services are provided without conducting required KYC and verification

**Failure to Report SMRs**:
- Civil penalty up to $31.3M for firms; $6.26M for individuals per missed report
- Also applies when SMRs are submitted late or contain inadequate information

**Failure to Report TTRs**:
- Civil penalty up to $31.3M for firms; $6.26M for individuals per missed report
- AUSTRAC has issued infringement notices (on-the-spot fines) for TTR failures

**Failure to Retain Records**:
- Civil penalty up to $31.3M for firms; $6.26M for individuals
- Applies when records are destroyed before the 7-year retention period expires or cannot be produced when AUSTRAC requests them

**Failure to Submit Compliance Reports**:
- Recent enforcement actions resulted in fines of **$3,300 for sole traders** and **$16,500 for companies** per violation
- In 2023, AUSTRAC handed out fines for failing to submit 2022 annual compliance reports

### Infringement Notices (On-the-Spot Fines)

AUSTRAC can issue infringement notices for less serious contraventions without going to court. These are fixed penalties that can be paid to settle the matter:

**For Companies**: Up to **$16,500** per contravention
**For Individuals**: Up to **$3,300** per contravention

Infringement notices are typically used for:
- Late or missed compliance reports
- Late TTR submissions
- Failure to update enrolment details
- Minor record-keeping deficiencies

Paying an infringement notice is not an admission of guilt, but failure to pay can result in court proceedings for civil penalties.

## Criminal Penalties

Certain serious breaches of the AML/CTF Act are criminal offenses, requiring proof of intent or recklessness and potentially resulting in imprisonment.

### Criminal Offenses and Maximum Penalties

**Tipping Off** (Section 123):
- **Offense**: Disclosing that an SMR has been submitted, that a transaction was not conducted due to ML/TF suspicion, or that an investigation is underway, when this disclosure is likely to prejudice the investigation
- **Penalty**: Up to **2 years imprisonment** and/or fines
- **Example**: Compliance officer tells a customer, "We had to report your trust establishment to AUSTRAC because we thought it looked suspicious." This is tipping off.

**Structuring** (Section 142):
- **Offense**: Organizing transactions to be conducted in a manner designed to avoid reporting obligations (e.g., breaking a $30,000 cash transaction into three $9,000 transactions to stay under the $10,000 TTR threshold)
- **Penalty**: Up to **5 years imprisonment** and/or significant fines
- **Example**: Client asks accounting firm to split a $25,000 invoice into three separate invoices under $10,000 each and requests payment in cash in separate installments. If the firm agrees and facilitates this, both the client and firm personnel could face structuring charges.

**False or Misleading Information** (Section 137.1 of Criminal Code as applied to AML/CTF reporting):
- **Offense**: Providing false or misleading information in reports to AUSTRAC (SMRs, TTRs, compliance reports) or during AUSTRAC investigations
- **Penalty**: Up to **12 months imprisonment** for individuals
- **Example**: Firm submits a compliance report claiming they conducted customer due diligence on 100 new customers when in fact they only completed due diligence on 50, deliberately misrepresenting compliance to avoid scrutiny.

**Conducting Transactions to Avoid Obligations**:
- **Offense**: Intentionally structuring business operations or transactions to avoid being subject to AML/CTF obligations
- **Penalty**: Criminal prosecution and significant penalties

### When Criminal Penalties Apply

Criminal penalties require proof of:
- **Intent**: The person deliberately engaged in the prohibited conduct knowing it was unlawful
- **Recklessness**: The person was aware of the risk their conduct would breach the law but proceeded anyway

Mere negligence or inadvertent non-compliance typically does not result in criminal charges—civil penalties would apply instead. However, systematic, deliberate, or reckless breaches, particularly those involving concealment, deception, or active evasion of obligations, can attract criminal prosecution.

## Examples of Non-Compliance Consequences

### Case Study 1: Major Bank - Systemic TTR Failures

**What Happened**:
A major Australian bank failed to report over 50,000 threshold transactions (cash deposits and withdrawals over $10,000) to AUSTRAC over several years. The failures were due to a coding error in the bank's transaction monitoring system that prevented TTRs from being automatically generated.

**Consequences**:
- AUSTRAC launched civil penalty proceedings in Federal Court
- Court ordered the bank to pay penalties of several million dollars
- Bank required to conduct independent review of all AML/CTF systems
- Ongoing AUSTRAC supervision and regular compliance reporting for 3 years
- Significant reputational damage, media coverage, and loss of customer trust
- Substantial legal and remediation costs
- Senior executives and board members faced internal accountability measures

**Lessons for Accounting Firms**:
- Technology failures are not an excuse—firms are responsible for ensuring systems work correctly
- Regular testing and quality assurance of compliance processes are essential
- Proactive identification and self-reporting of breaches may mitigate penalties

### Case Study 2: Financial Services Provider - Customer Due Diligence Failures

**What Happened**:
A financial services firm provided high-risk services (foreign exchange and money remittance) to customers without conducting adequate customer due diligence. The firm:
- Accepted customers without verifying identity using reliable sources (relied on customer self-declarations)
- Failed to identify beneficial owners of corporate customers
- Did not conduct ongoing monitoring
- Failed to submit SMRs despite numerous red flags (customers in high-risk jurisdictions, large cash transactions, inconsistent information)

**Consequences**:
- AUSTRAC investigation following a tip-off from another financial institution
- Federal Court proceedings for civil penalties
- Court found hundreds of contraventions and imposed penalties of over $10 million
- AUSTRAC prohibited the firm from onboarding new customers for 6 months pending remediation
- Firm required to appoint an independent expert to redesign AML/CTF program
- Ongoing reporting requirements to AUSTRAC
- Several key customers closed their accounts due to concerns about the firm's compliance
- Directors faced personal liability questions

**Lessons for Accounting Firms**:
- Shortcuts on customer due diligence create significant legal and business risk
- High-risk customer relationships require enhanced scrutiny—standard procedures are insufficient
- Red flags must be investigated and reported; ignoring them can lead to accusations of willful blindness

### Case Study 3: Accounting Firm - Failure to Enrol and Have AML/CTF Program

**Scenario** (Hypothetical, Based on Likely Enforcement Approach):
A mid-sized accounting firm provides designated services (company incorporations, trust establishments, ASIC agent services) to approximately 100 clients per year. The firm was aware of the July 1, 2026 deadline but:
- Did not enrol with AUSTRAC by March 31, 2026
- Continued providing designated services after July 1, 2026 without an AML/CTF program
- Conducted no customer due diligence on new clients
- Submitted no reports to AUSTRAC

**Likely Consequences** if Discovered:
- **Daily non-enrolment penalties**: $18,780 per day from July 1, 2026 until enrolment completed
  - If discovered 6 months later (December 31, 2026), penalties = $3,436,740
- **Civil penalties for failure to have AML/CTF program**: Up to $31.3M for the firm (actual penalty likely in the hundreds of thousands to low millions depending on circumstances)
- **Civil penalties for failure to conduct customer due diligence**: Potentially 100+ contraventions (one per customer), each attracting penalties
  - Actual penalties would likely be aggregated, but total penalties could easily reach millions of dollars
- **Costs**:
  - Legal fees for defending Federal Court proceedings
  - Costs of rapidly implementing compliance program under AUSTRAC supervision
  - Independent consultant fees for remediation and ongoing audits
- **Reputational harm**:
  - Media coverage
  - Loss of clients who question the firm's professionalism and integrity
  - Difficulty attracting new clients
  - Potential professional body disciplinary action (CPA, CA ANZ, IPA)
- **Personal liability**:
  - Partners or directors could face personal penalties for knowing involvement in non-compliance
  - Compliance officer (if appointed but ineffective) could face personal penalties

**Likely Outcome**:
Settlement with AUSTRAC for penalties in the range of $500,000 to $2 million (depending on cooperation, remediation efforts, and firm size), plus substantial costs and ongoing supervision.

### Case Study 4: Sole Practitioner - Late SMR Submission

**Scenario**:
A sole practitioner accountant establishes trusts and companies for clients. While conducting ongoing monitoring, the accountant notices that one client requested establishment of multiple companies and trusts over a short period, all with similar nominee directors and shareholders, with the client providing vague and inconsistent explanations about the purpose. The accountant suspects the structures may be designed to obscure beneficial ownership for money laundering purposes.

The accountant forms the suspicion on a Monday but is busy with year-end tax work and doesn't submit the SMR until the following Monday—8 days later (beyond the 3 business day requirement for money laundering suspicions).

**Consequences**:
- AUSTRAC becomes aware of the late submission through routine data analysis
- AUSTRAC contacts the accountant requesting an explanation for the delay
- AUSTRAC issues an infringement notice for late SMR submission: **$3,300**
- AUSTRAC adds the firm to a watch list for closer monitoring
- Next annual compliance report will require explanation of the breach and remediation steps

**Lessons**:
- SMR deadlines are strict—compliance processes must ensure timely reporting
- Workload pressures are not an excuse for non-compliance
- Even sole practitioners are fully accountable to the same standards as large institutions
- Minor breaches can escalate to major enforcement if patterns of non-compliance develop

### Case Study 5: Tipping Off - Criminal Prosecution

**Scenario**:
An accounting firm conducts customer due diligence on a new client seeking to establish a complex trust structure. During the process, the compliance officer identifies red flags suggesting the client may be attempting to hide assets from creditors or tax authorities. The firm submits an SMR to AUSTRAC.

A few weeks later, the client asks for an update on the trust establishment. A junior staff member, unaware of the tipping off prohibition, mentions, "We had to run some compliance checks and report to AUSTRAC about your matter, but it's all cleared now and we can proceed."

AUSTRAC is conducting an investigation into the client based on the SMR and multiple reports from other institutions. The client, now alerted, rapidly moves assets offshore and disappears.

**Consequences**:
- AUSTRAC refers the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for criminal investigation
- The junior staff member who made the disclosure is interviewed by AFP
- The compliance officer and firm principals are also interviewed regarding their training and supervision
- AFP lays criminal charges against the junior staff member for tipping off
- Criminal proceedings in court
- Potential conviction and up to 2 years imprisonment
- Firm faces civil penalties for inadequate training and supervision
- Firm faces reputational destruction and potential professional body deregistration

**Lessons**:
- All staff must be trained on tipping off prohibitions
- Scripts and guidance should be provided for client communications to avoid inadvertent disclosures
- When SMRs are submitted, firm should implement protocols to ensure client communications are carefully managed
- The consequences of tipping off are severe and can result in personal criminal liability

## AUSTRAC's Enforcement Approach

### Risk-Based Supervision

AUSTRAC uses a risk-based approach to supervision and enforcement:
- **Low-risk entities** with good compliance history receive lighter touch supervision (periodic compliance reports, occasional audits)
- **Medium-risk entities** receive more regular engagement, thematic reviews, and targeted audits
- **High-risk entities** or those with poor compliance history receive intensive supervision, frequent audits, and rapid enforcement for breaches

### Enforcement Tools

AUSTRAC has a range of enforcement tools:

1. **Education and Guidance**: For minor, inadvertent breaches by otherwise compliant entities, AUSTRAC may provide guidance and allow the entity to self-remediate

2. **Infringement Notices**: For less serious contraventions, on-the-spot fines without court proceedings

3. **Enforceable Undertakings**: AUSTRAC may accept a legally binding commitment from an entity to take specific remedial action, undergo external audits, enhance systems, or make compliance improvements in lieu of civil penalty proceedings

4. **Civil Penalty Proceedings**: Federal Court action seeking monetary penalties and court orders requiring remediation

5. **Criminal Prosecution**: Referral to AFP for criminal investigation and prosecution for serious, intentional breaches

### Factors AUSTRAC Considers in Enforcement Decisions

- **Seriousness and impact**: How significant was the breach? Did it undermine the integrity of the AML/CTF regime? Did it facilitate actual money laundering or terrorism financing?
- **Systemic vs. isolated**: Is this a one-off error or a pattern of non-compliance?
- **Intent**: Was the breach deliberate, reckless, negligent, or inadvertent?
- **Compliance culture**: Does the entity have a strong compliance culture and history, or is there evidence of indifference or willful blindness?
- **Self-reporting and cooperation**: Did the entity identify the breach themselves and self-report? Did they cooperate fully with AUSTRAC's investigation?
- **Remediation**: What steps has the entity taken to fix the breach and prevent recurrence?
- **Harm**: Did the breach result in actual harm (e.g., allowing criminal funds to flow, failing to detect terrorist financing)?
- **Deterrence**: What penalty is needed to deter this entity and others from similar conduct?

### AUSTRAC's 2025-26 Priorities

AUSTRAC has published regulatory expectations and priorities emphasizing:
- **Tranche 2 onboarding**: Ensuring newly regulated sectors (including accountants) have effective AML/CTF programs from day one
- **Beneficial ownership transparency**: Focus on accurate identification and verification of beneficial owners, particularly in complex structures
- **Suspicious matter reporting quality**: Emphasis on detailed, high-quality SMRs that provide actionable intelligence
- **Tipping off compliance**: Vigilance regarding inadvertent or deliberate disclosures to customers
- **Technology and innovation**: Encouraging use of technology to improve compliance efficiency while ensuring human oversight and judgment remain in place

Accounting firms should expect AUSTRAC to conduct thematic reviews and audits of the profession in the first 1-2 years after July 2026 to assess implementation effectiveness.
