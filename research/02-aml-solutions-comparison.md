## 5. DECISION FRAMEWORK

### For Very Small Firms (1-5 staff, <20 designated service clients/year)

**RECOMMENDED:**
- **Primary:** FREE AUSTRAC Starter Kit
- **Optional Add-on:** Integrate into existing practice management software
- **Rationale:** Low volume doesn't justify commercial software costs

**Total Cost:** $0-$500/year (staff time only)

---

### For Small Firms (5-15 staff, 20-100 designated service clients/year)

**RECOMMENDED:**
- **Option A:** AUSTRAC Starter Kit + Electronic Verification Service
- **Option B:** Professional body resources + practice management integration
- **Rationale:** Some automation valuable but full software overkill

**Total Cost:** $1,000-$3,000/year

---

### For Medium Firms (15-30 staff, 100-500 designated service clients/year)

**RECOMMENDED:**
- **Option A:** IRIS AML or similar commercial software
- **Option B:** Grant Thornton AUSTRAC Program (if budget allows)
- **Rationale:** Volume justifies automation investment; efficiency gains offset costs

**Total Cost:** $3,000-$10,000/year

---

### For Larger Firms (30+ staff, 500+ designated service clients/year)

**RECOMMENDED:**
- **Primary:** Grant Thornton AUSTRAC Program or enterprise AML software
- **Add-on:** Professional advisory support for complex scenarios
- **Rationale:** Compliance risk and volume require robust, automated solution

**Total Cost:** $10,000-$50,000+/year (including advisory)

---

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

---

### Phase 2: Development (March - June 2026)

---

## 7. KEY CONSIDERATIONS

### Cost vs. Benefit Analysis

**Manual Approach (Free Starter Kit):**
- **Cost:** $0 software + 10-20 hours/month staff time
- **Annual cost:** ~$15,000-$30,000 (staff time at $75/hour average)
- **Risk:** Higher risk of human error, missed reviews

**Automated Approach (Commercial Software):**
- **Cost:** $3,000-$10,000 software + 3-5 hours/month staff time
- **Annual cost:** ~$6,000-$15,000 total
- **Risk:** Lower risk, audit-ready, faster processing

**Break-Even Point:**
- Firms with 50+ designated service clients/year likely benefit from automation
- Firms with 100+ clients almost certainly ROI-positive for software

---

### Compliance Risk Mitigation

**Higher Risk = Greater Need for Robust Solution:**

**High-Risk Firms (consider commercial solutions):**
- Significant trust/company formation services
- International client base
- High-value transactions
- Complex ownership structures
- PEP clients

**Lower Risk Firms (manual approach may suffice):**
- Domestic clients only
- Simple structures
- Low transaction values
- Limited designated services
- Long-standing client relationships

---

### Scalability Considerations

**Plan for Growth:**
- Will your designated services expand?
- Are you acquiring other firms?
- Is client volume increasing?

**Avoid:**
- Starting with manual processes that can't scale
- Switching systems mid-compliance period (disruptive)

**Recommend:**
- Choose solution that can grow with your firm
- Build scalable processes from day one
