# Ongoing Compliance Obligations for Accounting Firms

Once customer onboarding is complete and designated services commence, accounting firms must maintain continuous compliance through ongoing customer due diligence, monitoring, record retention, and reporting. These obligations persist throughout the customer relationship and beyond.

## Monitoring Obligations

Ongoing customer due diligence (OCDD) is not a one-time activity—it's a continuous process of maintaining current customer information and detecting unusual or suspicious activity.

### What Must Be Monitored

**Customer Information Currency**:
- Verify that customer contact details, addresses, and business information remain accurate
- Confirm beneficial ownership hasn't changed (new shareholders, partners, trustees, appointors)
- Update occupation, employment, or business activity information
- Track changes in customer's risk profile

**Transaction Patterns**:
- Monitor services provided to customers to identify unusual patterns
- Compare actual activity against expected activity established during onboarding
- Look for transactions inconsistent with the customer's known business or financial profile
- Identify rapid movement of funds, large cash transactions, or structuring behavior (breaking transactions into smaller amounts to avoid reporting thresholds)

**Changes in Circumstances**:
- New designated services requested by the customer
- Customer becomes involved with high-risk jurisdictions
- Changes in ownership or control structure
- Customer becomes a politically exposed person or associate of a PEP
- Adverse media emerges about the customer (regulatory actions, criminal charges, civil litigation indicating fraud or financial misconduct)

**Behavioral Red Flags**:
- Customer becomes evasive or reluctant to provide updated information
- Customer provides inconsistent explanations for transactions or changes
- Customer requests unusual speed or secrecy
- Customer asks the firm to take actions that seem designed to avoid AML/CTF obligations

### Frequency of Monitoring

There is no mandated "review every X months" schedule. Instead, AUSTRAC requires a risk-based approach:

**Low-Risk Customers**:
- Review when triggered by specific events (e.g., new service request, change in circumstances)
- Periodic reviews may be infrequent (e.g., every 3-5 years) if the relationship remains static and low-risk
- Transaction monitoring may be limited to exception-based reviews (only investigating unusual items flagged by systems or staff)

**Medium-Risk Customers**:
- Review when triggered by events
- Periodic reviews every 2-3 years even if no specific trigger occurs
- Regular transaction monitoring to identify patterns that differ from baseline expectations

**High-Risk Customers**:
- Formal reviews at least annually, or more frequently (e.g., every 6 months) for very high-risk customers
- Continuous transaction monitoring with heightened sensitivity to anomalies
- Immediate investigation of any red flags or unusual activity

**Event-Driven Reviews**:
Regardless of risk rating, conduct a review when:
- Customer requests a new or different designated service
- Material change in customer's business structure, ownership, or control
- Customer's address or contact details change (especially if moving to high-risk jurisdiction)
- Adverse information emerges about the customer
- Transaction patterns change significantly from established baseline
- Customer becomes subject to sanctions or appears on watchlists
- Regulatory guidance identifies new risk factors affecting this customer type

### How Monitoring Is Conducted

**Manual Monitoring**:
For small firms with few designated service customers, manual monitoring may be sufficient:
- Quarterly or annual review of customer list to identify any changes or concerns
- Staff awareness and reporting of unusual customer requests or behavior
- Periodic check of customer information against public sources (ASIC searches, Google searches for adverse media)
- File notes documenting reviews and any findings

**Technology-Enabled Monitoring**:
Larger firms or those with higher-risk customer bases should implement:
- AML/CTF compliance software that flags customers due for review based on risk ratings and time elapsed since last review
- Transaction monitoring systems that compare activity against baseline patterns and flag anomalies
- Automated sanctions and PEP screening that periodically rescreens customers against updated watchlists
- Adverse media monitoring services that alert when negative news emerges about customers

**Triggers and Alerts**:
Effective systems generate alerts when:
- A customer's review due date arrives
- Transaction patterns deviate from expected norms (e.g., sudden increase in value or frequency)
- Customer name appears on updated sanctions lists
- Adverse media is detected
- Customer requests a service that increases their risk profile

Staff must investigate alerts, document findings, and escalate to the compliance officer when warranted.

## When Reviews Are Triggered

### Specific Trigger Events

**1. New Designated Service Request**:
- **What happens**: Customer who previously engaged the firm for non-designated services (e.g., tax preparation) now requests a designated service (e.g., establishing a trust)
- **Action required**: Conduct full customer due diligence as if onboarding a new customer, including identity verification, beneficial ownership identification, and risk assessment
- **Timeline**: Complete before providing the new designated service

**2. Material Change in Customer Structure**:
- **Examples**:
  - Company undergoes change of directors or shareholders meeting the 25% beneficial ownership threshold
  - Trust changes trustees, appointors, or primary beneficiaries
  - Partnership admits new partners or existing partners change ownership percentages
- **Action required**:
  - Identify and verify new beneficial owners
  - Reassess customer risk rating
  - Update records
- **Timeline**: As soon as practicable after becoming aware of the change, and before providing further designated services

**3. Customer Becomes High Risk**:
- **Examples**:
  - Customer takes on a politically exposed position
  - Customer begins operations in high-risk jurisdiction
  - Customer's industry or business activities change to higher-risk category
  - Adverse media indicates potential involvement in financial crime
- **Action required**:
  - Escalate to compliance officer or senior management
  - Conduct enhanced customer due diligence
  - Collect source of wealth and source of funds information
  - Obtain senior management approval to continue the relationship
  - Implement enhanced monitoring
- **Timeline**: Immediately upon identification of high-risk factors

**4. Suspicious Activity Detected**:
- **Examples**:
  - Transactions inconsistent with customer's known financial profile
  - Customer requests unusual secrecy or speed
  - Customer provides inconsistent explanations
  - Activity appears designed to avoid reporting thresholds (structuring)
  - Transactions involving known or suspected criminal associates
- **Action required**:
  - Investigate the activity and document findings
  - Determine whether grounds for suspicion exist
  - If suspicion forms, submit SMR to AUSTRAC within required timeframe (24 hours for terrorism financing, 3 business days for other offenses)
  - Escalate to compliance officer
  - Consider whether relationship should continue
- **Timeline**: Immediate investigation; SMR submission within statutory deadlines

**5. Inability to Complete Ongoing Due Diligence**:
- **Examples**:
  - Customer refuses to provide updated information
  - Cannot verify customer's continued identity or beneficial ownership
  - Customer's whereabouts unknown
- **Action required**:
  - Document attempts to complete due diligence
  - Escalate to compliance officer
  - Consider submitting SMR if refusal is suspicious
  - Terminate relationship if ongoing due diligence cannot be completed
  - Do not provide further designated services until due diligence is complete

**6. Regulatory or Internal Policy Changes**:
- **Examples**:
  - AUSTRAC issues new guidance changing risk assessment for certain customer types
  - Firm updates its AML/CTF program with stricter requirements
  - New sanctions lists require rescreening
- **Action required**:
  - Review affected customers against new criteria
  - Update risk assessments if warranted
  - Apply any new due diligence requirements
- **Timeline**: Within reasonable period after guidance or policy change (typically 3-6 months depending on scope)

## Record Retention Periods

### Seven-Year Retention Rule

The AML/CTF Act requires records to be retained for **7 years**, but the starting point for the retention period varies by record type.

### Retention Periods by Record Type

**Transaction Records**:
- **What**: Records of all transactions related to designated services, including invoices, receipts, trust account ledgers, correspondence about the transaction
- **Retention period**: 7 years from the date the transaction is completed
- **Example**: Invoice for establishing a trust on June 15, 2027 must be retained until at least June 15, 2034

**Customer Identification and Verification Records**:
- **What**: Copies of ID documents, ASIC searches, electronic verification results, beneficial ownership information, trust deeds, customer information forms
- **Retention period**: 7 years from the date the customer relationship ends
- **Example**: Customer engaged the firm from 2026 to 2031 (5 years). All customer identification records must be retained until at least 2038 (7 years after the 2031 relationship end)

**AML/CTF Program Documents**:
- **What**: All versions of the firm's AML/CTF program, risk assessments, board approvals
- **Retention period**: 7 years from the date the document is superseded by a new version
- **Example**: AML/CTF program version 1.0 implemented July 2026, updated to version 2.0 in January 2028. Version 1.0 must be retained until at least January 2035

**Ongoing Customer Due Diligence Records**:
- **What**: Risk assessment updates, review documentation, correspondence, file notes from ongoing monitoring
- **Retention period**: 7 years from the date the customer relationship ends
- **Note**: If new information is collected during the relationship and ongoing due diligence is conducted, previous CDD records must also be retained if reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance

**Training Records**:
- **What**: Training materials, attendance records, competency assessments
- **Retention period**: 7 years from the date of the training
- **Example**: Training session conducted August 2027 records must be retained until at least August 2034

**Reporting Records**:
- **What**: Copies of SMRs, TTRs, IFTIs, and compliance reports submitted to AUSTRAC, including supporting documentation and internal investigations that led to the reports
- **Retention period**: 7 years from the date the report was submitted to AUSTRAC

**Independent Review and Audit Reports**:
- **What**: Reports from independent reviews of the AML/CTF program, audit findings, management responses
- **Retention period**: 7 years from the date of the report

### Practical Retention Considerations

**When Does a Customer Relationship End?**:
A customer relationship ends when:
- Customer formally terminates the engagement
- Firm declines to provide further services
- Customer has not engaged the firm for designated services for an extended period (firm's policy might define this as 2-3 years of inactivity)
- Customer is deceased (for individual customers) or dissolved/deregistered (for entity customers)

**Documenting Relationship End Dates**:
Clearly document when customer relationships end, as this triggers the 7-year retention period for customer identification records. Without clear end dates, firms may retain records indefinitely, creating unnecessary data storage costs and privacy risks.

**Electronic vs. Paper Records**:
Either format is acceptable, but electronic records are strongly recommended:
- Easier to search and retrieve if AUSTRAC requests them
- Less physical storage space required
- Can implement automated retention schedules and deletion after retention periods expire
- Easier to secure and back up

**Secure Destruction After Retention Period**:
Once retention periods expire, securely destroy records containing personal information to comply with Privacy Act obligations. Shredding for paper records, secure deletion for electronic records.

## Reporting Requirements to AUSTRAC

### Suspicious Matter Reports (SMRs)

**Obligation**:
Submit an SMR when you form a suspicion on reasonable grounds that a transaction, customer, or matter relates to:
- Money laundering
- Terrorism financing
- Tax evasion, fraud, or other serious offenses against Australian law

**Timing**:
- **24 hours** for terrorism financing suspicions
- **3 business days** for money laundering or other criminal activity suspicions

**What Triggers an SMR**:
Suspicion is not certainty—you don't need proof. Suspicion forms when facts or circumstances would cause a reasonable person in your position to have a level of concern warranting further inquiry. Triggers include:

- **Unusual transaction patterns**: Frequency, size, or nature inconsistent with customer's known profile
- **Structuring**: Breaking transactions into amounts below $10,000 to avoid threshold reporting
- **Secrecy**: Customer requests unusual confidentiality or refuses to explain transactions
- **Inconsistent information**: Customer provides conflicting explanations or documentation that doesn't align with stated purpose
- **Red flag indicators**: Customer involves high-risk jurisdictions, uses nominees to obscure ownership, requests services that seem designed to hide assets or identity
- **Third-party tip-offs**: Law enforcement inquiries, media reports, or information from other sources suggesting criminal activity
- **Customer behavior**: Nervous, evasive, unusually interested in firm's AML/CTF procedures, asks about reporting thresholds

**Content of an SMR**:
The "5 Ws and H" framework:
- **Who**: Full details of the customer, beneficial owners, and any other parties involved
- **What**: Description of the transaction, activity, or matter giving rise to suspicion
- **Where**: Locations involved (addresses, jurisdictions)
- **When**: Dates and times of relevant transactions or activities
- **Why**: Your grounds for suspicion—the specific facts, patterns, red flags, or indicators that triggered the report
- **How**: Methods used to conduct the activity (cash, bank transfer, etc.)

**Quality Matters**:
AUSTRAC emphasizes that detailed, high-quality SMRs are far more valuable than brief, vague reports. Include:
- Specific dates, amounts, and account details
- Customer's explanation for the activity (if provided)
- Why you found the explanation insufficient or inconsistent
- Any corroborating information (e.g., "customer claims source of funds is business income, but company search shows business registered only 1 month ago with no apparent revenue")

**Tipping Off Prohibition**:
Once you submit an SMR (or decide not to provide services due to ML/TF suspicion), you must NOT disclose this to the customer or anyone else except:
- AUSTRAC
- Your legal advisor (for legal advice on your obligations)
- Law enforcement
- Your compliance officer or senior management within the firm

Disclosing that you've submitted an SMR to the customer is a criminal offense punishable by up to 2 years imprisonment. This prohibition prevents customers from being alerted that they're under suspicion, which could jeopardize law enforcement investigations.

### Threshold Transaction Reports (TTRs)

**Obligation**:
Report all physical currency transactions of A$10,000 or more (or foreign currency equivalent).

**Timing**: Within 10 business days of the transaction

**What Counts as Physical Currency**:
- Cash (Australian or foreign banknotes and coins)
- Bearer negotiable instruments (traveler's checks, bank drafts payable to bearer)

**What Doesn't Count**:
- Electronic funds transfers
- Checks, money orders made out to a specific payee
- Credit card payments
- Direct debits

**Examples for Accounting Firms**:

*Example 1*: Client pays a $15,000 invoice for company incorporation and structuring services in cash. This is a single transaction of A$10,000+ requiring a TTR.

*Example 2*: Client pays $8,000 cash for trust establishment services in the morning, then returns in the afternoon and pays another $5,000 cash for the same engagement. These are related transactions totaling $13,000 in a single business day—TTR required.

*Example 3*: Client pays $12,000 via bank transfer. No TTR required because it's not physical currency, even though it exceeds $10,000.

**Multiple Transactions**:
If a customer conducts multiple physical currency transactions that individually are under $10,000 but together total $10,000+ in a single business day, and you know or have reasonable grounds to believe they're related, you must submit a TTR for the combined amount.

**Structuring**:
If you suspect a customer is deliberately structuring transactions to avoid the $10,000 reporting threshold (e.g., making three $9,000 cash payments over three days instead of one $27,000 payment), this is grounds for an SMR in addition to any TTRs.

### Compliance Reports

**Obligation**:
Submit an annual compliance report to AUSTRAC detailing how your firm has met its AML/CTF obligations during the reporting period (typically the financial year).

**Timing**:
AUSTRAC specifies the reporting period and due date. For most reporting entities, the period aligns with the financial year (July 1 - June 30), with reports due by a specified date (typically September or October).

**Content**:
- Number of customers and breakdown by risk rating (low, medium, high)
- Number and types of designated services provided
- Customer due diligence activities:
  - Number of new customers onboarded
  - Number of ongoing due diligence reviews conducted
  - Number of customers subject to enhanced due diligence
- Reporting:
  - Number of SMRs submitted
  - Number of TTRs submitted
  - Number of other reports (IFTIs, if applicable)
- Training and awareness:
  - Number of staff trained
  - Topics covered
  - Frequency of training
- AML/CTF program:
  - Material changes to the program during the period
  - Independent reviews or audits conducted
  - Material compliance breaches identified and remediated
- Compliance officer details

**Penalties for Non-Compliance**:
Failure to submit compliance reports has resulted in fines of **$3,300 for sole traders** and **$16,500 for companies** per violation. In some cases, AUSTRAC has launched civil penalty proceedings for persistent non-compliance.

**Purpose**:
Compliance reports help AUSTRAC:
- Understand the reporting entity population and their activities
- Assess industry-wide compliance levels
- Identify entities that may warrant closer supervision or audit
- Gather data for ML/TF risk assessments and strategic analysis

### International Funds Transfer Instructions (IFTIs)

**Obligation**:
Report instructions for international funds transfers (transfers of money to or from Australia involving foreign jurisdictions).

**Applicability to Accounting Firms**:
Most accounting firms will not trigger IFTI obligations, as these primarily apply to financial institutions and money remitters that conduct, arrange, or instruct international transfers on behalf of customers.

However, if an accounting firm directly arranges or instructs international transfers as part of designated services (e.g., moving client funds offshore as part of trust or company management), IFTI reporting may be required.

**Timing**: Within 10 business days of the instruction

**Content**: Details of the sender, recipient, amount, currency, originating and destination institutions, and instruction date.

## Ongoing Compliance Calendar

To maintain compliance, accounting firms should implement a compliance calendar tracking:

### Monthly Activities
- Review new customers onboarded during the month for completeness
- Check that all SMRs and TTRs were submitted within required timeframes
- Monitor alerts and follow up on any requiring investigation
- Update customer records based on any changes identified

### Quarterly Activities
- Review high-risk customers for any changes in circumstances
- Conduct quality assurance spot checks on customer files to ensure procedures were followed
- Review sanctions and PEP lists for any updates affecting customers
- Hold compliance officer meeting to discuss emerging risks or issues

### Annual Activities
- Conduct risk assessment reviews for all customers due for scheduled review
- Prepare and submit annual compliance report to AUSTRAC
- Conduct staff training and awareness refreshers
- Review and update AML/CTF program if changes to business or risk environment occurred
- Conduct or commission independent review of AML/CTF program (at least every 2 years)

### Event-Driven Activities
- Respond to AUSTRAC requests for information or records
- Investigate and report suspicious matters as they arise
- Onboard new customers when designated services are requested
- Update customer due diligence when material changes occur
- Submit TTRs within 10 business days of physical currency transactions over $10,000
