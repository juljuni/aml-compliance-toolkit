# Current AML/CTF Compliance Solutions for Australian Accounting Firms

## Overview of Available Solutions

As accounting firms prepare for the July 2026 AML/CTF compliance deadline, several solutions have emerged to help meet obligations. These range from guidance and templates provided by professional bodies to comprehensive commercial software platforms. The right solution depends on firm size, service offerings, risk profile, and budget.

## Professional Body Offerings

### CPA Australia

**Guidance and Resources**:

CPA Australia has been actively supporting members through the transition to AML/CTF regulation, providing educational resources, guidance documents, and policy advocacy.

**Available Resources**:
- **Educational webinars and seminars**: Regular sessions explaining AML/CTF obligations, implementation timelines, and practical compliance strategies

CPA Australia has raised concerns with government and AUSTRAC about:
- The compressed implementation timeline
- Need for proportionate obligations recognizing the difference between accounting firms and financial institutions
- Importance of practical, sector-specific guidance rather than generic regulatory materials
- Cost burden on small practices

**Limitations**:
- CPA Australia provides guidance and education but does not offer a turnkey compliance software solution
- Members must still develop their own AML/CTF programs, policies, and procedures
- No technology platform for customer due diligence, monitoring, or reporting
- Firms must separately source software or manage compliance manually

**Pricing**:
- Most guidance and educational resources are available at no additional cost to CPA Australia members as part of standard membership
- Membership fees vary based on membership category (ranging from approximately $400-$900 annually for practicing members)

### Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ)

**Guidance and Resources**:

- Extended implementation timelines to allow adequate preparation
- Clear guidance on designated services and what triggers obligations
- Recognition of different risk profiles between accounting services and financial services

**Limitations**:
- Like CPA Australia, CA ANZ provides guidance and templates but not a comprehensive technology solution

## Key Considerations When Choosing a Solution

### Firm Size and Transaction Volume

- **Sole practitioners and micro-firms** (1-3 staff, <20 designated service customers/year):
  - May manage compliance manually using professional body templates
  - Entry-level software ($1,200/year) may be cost-effective for efficiency and reducing errors
  - Focus on simple, user-friendly solutions requiring minimal training

- **Small firms** (4-10 staff, 20-100 designated service customers/year):
  - Entry to mid-tier software platforms recommended
  - Balance cost against time savings and compliance risk reduction
  - Look for solutions integrating with existing practice management systems

- **Medium to large firms** (10+ staff, 100+ designated service customers/year):
  - Comprehensive software platform essential
  - Consider solutions with advanced features (transaction monitoring, automated rescreening, detailed reporting)
  - Budget for staff training, system implementation, and ongoing support

### Risk Profile

- **Low-risk firms** (mostly Australian individual and company clients, standard structures, no high-risk jurisdictions):
  - Basic compliance tools may suffice
  - Manual processes with professional body templates viable for very small volumes

- **Medium to high-risk firms** (complex structures, foreign clients, high-risk jurisdictions, PEPs, large transactions):
  - Sophisticated software with enhanced due diligence workflows, sanctions screening, and transaction monitoring critical
  - Consider solutions with strong audit trail and reporting capabilities for demonstrating compliance to AUSTRAC

### Technology Integration

- Firms with established CRM or practice management systems should prioritize solutions that integrate (e.g., StackGo for HubSpot/Salesforce users, IRIS for IRIS practice management users)
- Standalone solutions may create dual data entry burden and workflow friction
- API availability and integration capabilities should be evaluated

### Budget

- Total cost of compliance includes:
  - Software subscription fees
  - Implementation and setup costs
  - Staff training time
  - Ongoing compliance officer time
  - External verification service fees (DVS, ASIC searches, electronic ID verification)
  - Independent review/audit costs (every 2 years)

- For small firms, total annual cost may range from $2,000-$5,000 (software + time + external costs)
- For medium to large firms, costs could exceed $10,000-$50,000 annually depending on scale and complexity

### Recommendation from AUSTRAC

AUSTRAC has advised public practices to **contact AUSTRAC or professional bodies (CPA Australia, CA ANZ, IPA) before purchasing software** to ensure solutions meet regulatory requirements. This suggests:
- Not all commercial solutions are equal in quality or regulatory alignment
- Firms should verify that software adequately addresses their specific obligations
- Professional body consultation can help avoid costly mistakes
