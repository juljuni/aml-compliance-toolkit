# Legal Obligations Under the AML/CTF Act for Accounting Firms

## Core "Must Do" Requirements

The AML/CTF Act imposes several mandatory obligations on accounting firms once they become reporting entities by providing designated services. These requirements are not optional or aspirational—they are legal obligations backed by significant penalties for non-compliance.

### 1. Enrolment with AUSTRAC

**Requirement**: Every reporting entity must enrol with AUSTRAC before providing designated services.

**Timeline**:
- Enrolment opens March 31, 2026
- Must be completed before July 1, 2026 or before providing any designated services, whichever comes first
- Cannot enrol before March 31, 2026

**What's Required**:
- Business details including ABN, ACN (if applicable), business name, and trading names
- Principal place of business and all other business locations
- Contact details for the business and key personnel
- Compliance officer details
- Description of designated services offered
- Estimated transaction volumes and values

**Penalties for Non-Enrolment**:
- $18,780 per day for firms
- $3,756 per day for individuals
- These penalties accrue daily from the date designated services are provided without enrolment

### 2. AML/CTF Program Development and Maintenance

**Requirement**: Firms must develop, maintain, and comply with a written AML/CTF program appropriate to the size, nature, and complexity of their business.

**Program Components - Part A (Risk Management and Systems)**:

The program must include:

- **ML/TF risk assessment**: A documented assessment identifying and evaluating money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing risks specific to your business, including:
  - Customer risks (who your clients are, their business activities, geographic locations)
  - Service/product risks (which designated services carry higher risks)
  - Delivery channel risks (in-person, remote, intermediaries)
  - Geographic risks (foreign jurisdictions involved in client structures or transactions)

- **Systems and controls**: Documented procedures for:
  - Customer identification and verification (initial due diligence)
  - Ongoing customer due diligence and transaction monitoring
  - Enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers
  - Reporting to AUSTRAC (suspicious matters, threshold transactions)
  - Record creation and retention
  - Employee screening and training
  - Independent review and testing of the program

- **Board and senior management approval**: A senior manager must formally approve the AML/CTF program in writing

- **Ongoing customer due diligence (OCDD)**: Systems to:
  - Determine whether additional customer information should be collected on an ongoing basis
  - Ensure customer information remains current and accurate
  - Monitor transactions to identify unusual or suspicious activity
  - Decide when enhanced due diligence is required

**Program Components - Part B (Customer Identification Procedures)**:

Detailed, documented procedures specifying:
- What information will be collected to verify customer identity
- What documents or data sources will be used for verification
- How different customer types will be identified (individuals, companies, trusts, partnerships)
- Processes for identifying beneficial owners (the natural persons who ultimately own or control the customer)
- Timeframes for completing identification and verification
- Procedures when verification cannot be completed

**Risk-Based Approach**: The program must be proportionate. A sole practitioner offering limited designated services can have a simpler program than a large firm with diverse, high-risk services. However, "simple" does not mean inadequate—all required elements must be addressed.

### 3. Compliance Officer Appointment

**Requirement**: Appoint a compliance officer responsible for:
- Ensuring the firm meets its AML/CTF obligations
- Monitoring compliance with the AML/CTF program
- Reporting compliance matters to senior management or the board
- Acting as the primary contact with AUSTRAC

**Qualifications**: The compliance officer must:
- Hold a position of sufficient seniority and authority within the firm
- Have adequate knowledge of AML/CTF obligations
- Have sufficient resources to fulfill the role

For sole practitioners, the principal is typically the compliance officer. In larger firms, this might be a dedicated compliance manager or senior partner.

### 4. Customer Due Diligence (CDD)

**Requirement**: Before providing designated services, firms must:

**Identify the customer** by collecting:
- Full name (or registered business name for entities)
- Date of birth (for individuals)
- Residential address or principal place of business
- For companies: ACN, ABN, registered office, place of incorporation
- For trusts: trust name, type, ABN (if applicable), trustee details

**Verify the customer's identity** using reliable, independent sources such as:
- Government-issued photo identification (driver's license, passport)
- Documents issued by Commonwealth, state, or territory government agencies
- ASIC searches for companies
- Original trust deeds for trusts
- Electronic verification services using government or reliable commercial databases

**Identify beneficial owners**: Determine the natural persons who:
- Own 25% or more of the customer entity
- Exercise control over the customer entity (even if they don't meet the 25% ownership threshold)

**Verify beneficial owners**: Confirm the identity of beneficial owners using the same reliable sources required for customer verification.

**Timing**: Customer due diligence must be completed before providing the designated service. There is no grace period to "catch up" after the fact except in limited, specific circumstances defined in the legislation.

### 5. Ongoing Customer Due Diligence (OCDD)

**Requirement**: Monitoring and maintaining customer information throughout the business relationship.

**What This Involves**:
- Reviewing whether customer information remains current and accurate
- Conducting transaction monitoring to identify unusual patterns or activities
- Reassessing customer risk ratings if circumstances change
- Collecting additional information when risk increases or suspicious activity is identified
- Updating customer records as new information becomes available

**Triggers for Enhanced Review**:
- Customer requests a new or different designated service
- Significant change in customer's business structure or ownership
- Customer's transaction patterns change materially
- Customer becomes associated with higher-risk jurisdictions or activities
- Adverse media, regulatory actions, or other negative information emerges about the customer

**Frequency**: There is no mandated schedule (e.g., "review annually"). Instead, firms must implement risk-based systems that trigger reviews when circumstances warrant. Higher-risk customers require more frequent monitoring than low-risk customers.

### 6. Enhanced Customer Due Diligence (ECDD)

**Requirement**: Apply additional scrutiny and verification measures when money laundering or terrorism financing risk is high.

**Mandatory ECDD Situations**:
- Customer is a foreign politically exposed person (PEP)—a current or former senior government official, senior executive of a government corporation, senior political party official, or immediate family member of such persons from a foreign country
- Domestic PEP where circumstances indicate higher risk
- Customer is from or conducting business with high-risk jurisdictions (countries with weak AML/CTF controls or subject to international sanctions)
- A suspicious matter reporting obligation arises
- Customer or transaction involves complex ownership structures designed to obscure beneficial ownership
- Customer's stated source of funds or wealth is inconsistent with known information

**Enhanced Measures May Include**:
- Collecting and verifying source of funds (where money for a specific transaction came from)
- Collecting and verifying source of wealth (how the customer accumulated their overall wealth)
- Obtaining senior management approval to commence or continue the business relationship
- Conducting more frequent ongoing reviews
- Obtaining additional documentation about the purpose of the relationship or specific transactions
- Enhanced monitoring of transaction patterns and activities

### 7. Record Keeping

**Requirement**: Create and retain specific records for mandated periods.

**Transaction Records** (7 years):
- Details of all transactions related to designated services
- Identity of parties involved
- Nature and purpose of the transaction
- Amount and currency
- Date of transaction
- Account numbers or references (if applicable)

**Customer Identification Records** (7 years from end of relationship):
- All documents and information collected during customer due diligence
- Verification documents (copies of ID, ASIC searches, electronic verification results)
- Beneficial ownership information
- Risk assessment documentation
- Records of ongoing due diligence activities

**Important**: When you collect new or updated customer information during an ongoing relationship, you must retain previous CDD records if reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance. For example, if a customer's beneficial ownership changes and you collect new information, keep both the old and new records.

**AML/CTF Program Records**:
- All versions of your AML/CTF program and when they were in effect
- Board or senior management approvals
- Risk assessments
- Training records
- Independent review reports

**Format**: Records can be electronic or paper, but must be readily accessible if AUSTRAC requests them. Electronic records are recommended for searchability and efficiency.

### 8. Reporting to AUSTRAC

**Suspicious Matter Reports (SMRs)**:

**Requirement**: Report to AUSTRAC when you form a suspicion on reasonable grounds that:
- A transaction, customer, or matter may involve money laundering
- A transaction, customer, or matter may involve terrorism financing
- A transaction, customer, or matter may relate to an offense against Australian law (including tax evasion, fraud, or other serious crimes)

**Timing**:
- Within 24 hours for terrorism financing suspicions
- Within 3 business days for money laundering or other criminal activity suspicions

**No Minimum Threshold**: Unlike threshold transaction reports, SMRs have no minimum dollar amount. A suspicion can arise from small transactions, unusual patterns, customer behavior, or inconsistencies in information provided.

**Content**: SMRs must include the "5 Ws and H":
- Who: Parties involved, including customer details, beneficial owners, and any other relevant persons
- What: Description of the transaction, activity, or matter giving rise to the suspicion
- Where: Location(s) where activity occurred, jurisdictions involved
- When: Dates and times of relevant transactions or activities
- Why: Your grounds for suspicion—the specific facts, patterns, or indicators that triggered the report
- How: How the activity was conducted, including methods, instruments, and channels used

**Threshold Transaction Reports (TTRs)**:

**Requirement**: Report all physical currency transactions of A$10,000 or more (or foreign currency equivalent).

**Examples**:
- Client pays a $15,000 invoice in cash
- Client deposits $12,000 cash toward a company incorporation fee
- Multiple related cash transactions totaling $10,000 or more in a single business day

**Timing**: Within 10 business days of the transaction

**Purpose**: TTRs help AUSTRAC identify patterns of cash usage that may indicate criminal activity, tax evasion, or money laundering, even when individual transactions don't appear suspicious.

**International Funds Transfer Instructions (IFTIs)**:

Accounting firms are less likely to trigger IFTI obligations, which primarily apply to financial institutions facilitating international money transfers. However, if an accounting firm arranges or conducts international transfers as part of designated services, IFTI reporting may be required.

**Compliance Reports**:

**Requirement**: Submit an annual compliance report to AUSTRAC detailing how your firm has met its AML/CTF obligations during the reporting period.

**Content**:
- Number and type of designated services provided
- Number of customers and risk profile distribution
- Customer due diligence activities conducted
- Suspicious matter reports submitted
- Training provided to staff
- Independent reviews or audits conducted
- Material breaches or compliance issues identified
- Changes to the AML/CTF program

**Timing**: Annually, by the due date specified by AUSTRAC (typically within a specific window after the financial year end)

**Penalties for Non-Reporting**: Failure to submit compliance reports has resulted in fines of $3,300 for sole traders to $16,500 for companies per violation.

### 9. Employee Screening, Training, and Awareness

**Requirement**: Ensure employees involved in designated services or AML/CTF compliance have:

**Appropriate Screening**:
- Background checks appropriate to their role and level of risk
- Verification of qualifications and employment history
- Ongoing monitoring for conflicts of interest or integrity concerns

**Initial and Ongoing Training**:
- Understanding of AML/CTF obligations and the firm's program
- How to identify suspicious activities and red flags
- Customer identification and verification procedures
- Reporting requirements and escalation processes
- Consequences of non-compliance

**Awareness Programs**:
- Regular updates on emerging threats and typologies
- Case studies and examples relevant to accounting services
- Changes to legislation, regulations, or firm procedures

Training must be documented, including who was trained, when, what topics were covered, and how competency was assessed.

### 10. Independent Review

**Requirement**: Conduct regular, independent reviews of your AML/CTF program to test its effectiveness and compliance with legal obligations.

**Frequency**: At least every two years, or more frequently if:
- Significant changes to the business occur
- New or emerging risks are identified
- Material compliance failures are detected
- AUSTRAC or industry guidance recommends increased testing

**Independence**: The reviewer must be:
- Independent of the functions being reviewed
- Qualified to assess AML/CTF compliance
- Provided with adequate resources and access to conduct the review

For small firms, independence might be achieved by engaging an external consultant or auditor. Larger firms may have internal audit functions that are independent of operational areas.

**Scope**: The review should assess:
- Whether the AML/CTF program adequately addresses the firm's ML/TF risks
- Compliance with program requirements in practice
- Effectiveness of customer due diligence procedures
- Adequacy of record keeping
- Quality and timeliness of reporting to AUSTRAC
- Training and awareness effectiveness
- Recommendations for improvements

## What Triggers Different Obligation Levels

Not all obligations apply with equal intensity to every firm or customer. The AML/CTF framework is explicitly risk-based, meaning:

**Low Risk Customers and Situations**:
- Standard customer identification and verification sufficient
- Less intensive ongoing monitoring required
- Simplified record keeping may be appropriate

**Medium Risk**:
- Standard customer due diligence applies
- Regular ongoing monitoring required
- Standard record keeping and reporting obligations

**High Risk**:
- Enhanced customer due diligence mandatory
- More frequent and intensive ongoing monitoring
- Senior management oversight required
- Additional documentation and verification of source of funds/wealth
- Heightened reporting sensitivity

**Risk Factors That Elevate Obligations**:
- Customer is a foreign politically exposed person
- Customer operates in high-risk industries (e.g., money services, cryptocurrency, cash-intensive businesses)
- Customer is based in or has connections to high-risk jurisdictions
- Complex ownership structures with nominees, bearer shares, or offshore entities
- Transactions inconsistent with the customer's known business or financial profile
- Customer reluctant to provide information or documentation
- Adverse media or regulatory history
- Rapid movement of funds without clear business purpose

## Threshold Amounts and Service Types

**$10,000 Physical Currency Threshold**: The primary threshold amount in AML/CTF law is $10,000 Australian dollars (or foreign currency equivalent) for:
- Threshold transaction reports (TTRs) when physical cash is involved
- Triggering enhanced scrutiny in risk assessments
- Assessing whether transactions are structured to avoid reporting (e.g., multiple $9,000 transactions)

**No Threshold for SMRs**: Suspicious matter reports have no minimum dollar amount. A series of small transactions, unusual customer behavior, or inconsistent information can trigger reporting obligations regardless of value.

**Designated Service Triggers**: AML/CTF obligations are service-triggered, not value-triggered:
- Establishing a $1 proprietary limited company triggers the same customer due diligence requirements as establishing a multi-million dollar trust
- Acting as an ASIC agent to register a business name requires compliance regardless of the fee charged
- The value of the underlying assets or transactions involved in the designated service is not the determining factor for whether obligations apply (though it may influence risk assessment)

## Record Keeping Requirements and Timelines Summary

| Record Type | Retention Period | When Period Starts |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Transaction records | 7 years | Date of transaction |
| Customer identification records | 7 years | End of customer relationship |
| Beneficial owner information | 7 years | End of customer relationship |
| AML/CTF program versions | 7 years | Date superseded by new version |
| Training records | 7 years | Date of training |
| Risk assessments | 7 years | Date superseded by updated assessment |
| SMRs and TTRs | 7 years | Date of report to AUSTRAC |
| Compliance reports | 7 years | Date submitted to AUSTRAC |
| Independent review reports | 7 years | Date of report |

**Critical Point**: The 7-year retention period for customer identification records begins when the customer relationship ends, not when the relationship begins. For long-standing clients, this could mean retaining records for many years. When the relationship ends (e.g., the client moves to another firm or no longer requires designated services), the 7-year clock starts.
