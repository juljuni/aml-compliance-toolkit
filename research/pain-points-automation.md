- **Large firm**: $31,500-$103,750 (initial) + $117,375-$295,000/year (ongoing)

Plus software, external verification services, and independent review costs.

## Common Bottlenecks for Small Firms

### 1. Customer Identity Verification

**Problem**:
Collecting and verifying identity documents is time-consuming, especially for remote clients or when original documents must be sighted and certified copies obtained.

**Bottleneck Impacts**:
- Client onboarding delays (waiting for documents to be mailed, certified, returned)
- Poor customer experience (clients frustrated by document requests)
- Incomplete files (clients don't respond or provide partial documentation)
- Staff time chasing documents and following up with clients

**Manual Process Pain Points**:
- Emailing clients to request ID documents
- Waiting for client to find documents, get certification, and send
- Manually checking documents against verification criteria
- Manually conducting ASIC searches or other verification steps
- Manually filing documents in customer records

**Time Per Customer (Manual)**: 30-45 minutes of active time, plus 3-7 days elapsed time waiting for documents

### 2. Beneficial Ownership Identification for Complex Structures

**Problem**:
Identifying who ultimately owns or controls trusts, companies, and partnerships with multi-layered structures is complex, particularly for discretionary trusts, corporate trustees, and entities with offshore components.

**Bottleneck Impacts**:
- Difficulty determining who meets the 25% beneficial ownership threshold
- Client confusion when asked to explain complex ownership chains
- Risk of missing beneficial owners or misidentifying control relationships
- Incomplete or incorrect beneficial ownership records leading to compliance deficiencies

**Manual Process Pain Points**:
- Reading and interpreting trust deeds to identify appointors, guardians, and beneficiaries
- Tracing ownership through multiple layers (e.g., trust → corporate trustee → shareholders of corporate trustee)
- Asking clients to explain structures when they may not fully understand them themselves
- Creating ownership diagrams manually
- Verifying identity of all identified beneficial owners (multiplying the ID verification bottleneck)

**Time Per Complex Structure (Manual)**: 45-90 minutes, with potential for significant back-and-forth with clients

### 3. Risk Assessment and Rating

**Problem**:
Assigning consistent, defensible risk ratings to customers requires evaluating multiple factors and balancing them to reach an overall rating. Without structured frameworks, risk assessments can be subjective, inconsistent, or inadequate.

**Bottleneck Impacts**:
- Inconsistent risk ratings across different staff members
- Under-rating high-risk customers (leading to inadequate due diligence)
- Over-rating low-risk customers (wasting resources on unnecessary enhanced due diligence)
- Difficulty justifying risk ratings to AUSTRAC in an audit

**Manual Process Pain Points**:
- Staff uncertainty about how to weight different risk factors
- Lack of clear guidance on what constitutes "high risk" vs. "medium risk"
- Failure to consider all relevant factors (e.g., forgetting to check PEP status or sanctions lists)
- Inconsistent documentation of risk assessment rationale

**Time Per Customer (Manual)**: 15-30 minutes, with high variability and potential for errors

### 4. Ongoing Monitoring and Triggering Reviews

**Problem**:
Remembering to conduct periodic reviews of customers, rescreening against updated PEP/sanctions lists, and monitoring for changes in circumstances is difficult without automated systems.

**Bottleneck Impacts**:
- Customers go years without reviews (non-compliance with ongoing due diligence obligations)
- Changes in customer risk profile go undetected (e.g., customer becomes a PEP, moves to high-risk jurisdiction, or appears on sanctions list)
- Reactive rather than proactive compliance (only reviewing when issues arise)

**Manual Process Pain Points**:
- No systematic trigger for periodic reviews—relies on staff memory or manual calendar reminders
- Time-consuming to manually rescreen all customers against updated sanctions lists
- Difficult to detect subtle changes in customer circumstances without prompting
- No transaction monitoring to identify unusual patterns

**Time for Manual Monitoring**: 5-10 hours/year for small customer base, but often neglected due to lack of systems

### 5. Suspicious Matter Report Preparation

**Problem**:
When suspicious activity is detected, preparing a comprehensive, high-quality SMR with all required information ("5 Ws and H") is time-consuming and stressful, particularly for firms with limited experience.

**Bottleneck Impacts**:
- Delayed SMR submissions (missing 3-day or 24-hour deadlines)
- Low-quality SMRs missing key details (reducing value to AUSTRAC and law enforcement)
- Staff anxiety about whether suspicion threshold is met and what to include
- Fear of tipping off customer during investigation

**Manual Process Pain Points**:
- Gathering all transaction details, customer information, and supporting documentation
- Articulating grounds for suspicion clearly
- Navigating AUSTRAC's online reporting system
- Ensuring confidentiality and avoiding tipping off
- No templates or guidance specific to accounting firm scenarios

**Time Per SMR (Manual)**: 2-4 hours, with significant stress and uncertainty

### 6. Record Retention and Retrieval

**Problem**:
Maintaining organized, accessible records for 7 years (or 7 years after relationship ends) is challenging with paper-based or poorly organized electronic systems.

**Bottleneck Impacts**:
- Inability to quickly locate records if AUSTRAC requests them during an audit
- Risk of inadvertently destroying records before retention period expires
- Excessive storage costs for paper records
- Privacy risks from poor security of personal information

**Manual Process Pain Points**:
- Filing paper documents in physical cabinets
- Inconsistent electronic file naming and organization
- No systematic retention schedule or automated deletion after retention periods
- Difficulty searching across multiple file locations for specific customer information

**Time for Record Management**: Ongoing burden throughout relationship; acute problem during AUSTRAC audits (can take days to locate all required records)

### 7. Training and Keeping Current

**Problem**:
AML/CTF regulations, AUSTRAC guidance, and emerging threats evolve continuously. Keeping staff trained and aware of changes is resource-intensive.

**Bottleneck Impacts**:
- Staff use outdated procedures or misunderstand current obligations
- Missed regulatory updates leading to non-compliance
- Inconsistent knowledge across team members

**Manual Process Pain Points**:
- Monitoring AUSTRAC website, professional body updates, and industry news for changes
- Developing training materials and delivering sessions
- Documenting training attendance and competency
- Refresher training to maintain awareness

**Time for Training**: 3-5 hours/year per staff member, plus time for compliance officer to prepare materials

## Manual vs. Automatable Tasks

### Tasks That Are Highly Automatable

**1. Electronic Identity Verification**:
- **Manual**: Request documents, receive, visually inspect, record details, conduct ASIC searches
- **Automated**: Customer enters details into software, software queries DVS or electronic verification service, instant verification result with audit trail
- **Automation Benefit**: 70-80% time reduction; improved accuracy; instant results

**2. PEP and Sanctions Screening**:
- **Manual**: Google customer name, search media for PEP status, manually check DFAT sanctions list
- **Automated**: Software screens customer against global PEP and sanctions databases in seconds
- **Automation Benefit**: 90%+ time reduction; comprehensive coverage of global watchlists; real-time updates

**3. Risk Rating Calculation**:
- **Manual**: Staff evaluates risk factors and assigns subjective rating
- **Automated**: Software applies consistent algorithm based on configurable risk criteria, assigns rating, documents rationale
- **Automation Benefit**: Consistency, defensibility, speed (instant vs. 15-30 min manual)

**4. Periodic Rescreening**:
- **Manual**: Set calendar reminders, manually rescreen customers
- **Automated**: Software automatically rescreens all customers monthly or quarterly against updated PEP/sanctions lists, alerts if new hits
- **Automation Benefit**: Ensures no customers are missed; continuous monitoring vs. periodic manual effort

**5. AUSTRAC Report Preparation**:
- **Manual**: Gather data from multiple sources, manually complete report forms
- **Automated**: Software pre-populates reports with customer data, transaction details, and compliance activity statistics
- **Automation Benefit**: 50-70% time reduction; reduced errors; consistency

**6. Record Retention Management**:
- **Manual**: Manually track retention periods, set reminders to destroy records
- **Automated**: Software tracks retention periods, alerts when records eligible for deletion, automates secure deletion
- **Automation Benefit**: Reduced compliance risk; storage cost savings; privacy compliance

**7. Compliance Calendar and Alerts**:
- **Manual**: Spreadsheets or calendar reminders for reviews, report deadlines, training
- **Automated**: Software generates alerts for upcoming reviews, report deadlines, and overdue tasks
- **Automation Benefit**: Nothing falls through cracks; proactive rather than reactive compliance

### Tasks That Require Human Judgment (Difficult to Automate)

**1. Forming Suspicion for SMRs**:
- **Why Manual**: Suspicion requires evaluating facts, context, customer behavior, and "gut feel" based on experience
- **Role of Technology**: Can flag anomalies and patterns for human review, but final suspicion determination and decision to report is human judgment
- **Partial Automation**: Software can alert on red flags; staff investigates and decides

**2. Enhanced Due Diligence Inquiries**:
- **Why Manual**: Collecting source of wealth/funds information often requires nuanced conversation with customer, judgment about what's sufficient, and interpretation of documents
- **Role of Technology**: Can provide workflows and checklists, but execution is human
- **Partial Automation**: Templates and guided workflows streamline, but human inquiry essential

**3. Complex Beneficial Ownership Analysis**:
- **Why Manual**: Interpreting trust deeds, understanding control mechanisms, identifying de facto control beyond legal ownership requires legal and business judgment
- **Role of Technology**: Can visualize ownership structures, flag structures meeting thresholds, but interpretation is human
- **Partial Automation**: Ownership mapping tools assist, but analysis is human-driven

**4. Customer Communication and Relationship Management**:
- **Why Manual**: Explaining AML/CTF requirements to customers, managing their concerns, maintaining relationships requires interpersonal skills
- **Role of Technology**: Can provide scripts and FAQs, but delivery is human

**5. AML/CTF Program Design and Customization**:
- **Why Manual**: Tailoring the program to firm's specific risks, services, and culture requires strategic thinking and expertise
- **Role of Technology**: Templates provide starting points, but customization is human
- **Partial Automation**: Software templates reduce drafting time, but customization essential

## Strategic Recommendations

**For Sole Practitioners and Micro-Firms**:
- Entry-level software (~$1,200/year) delivers strong ROI even with small transaction volumes
- Focus on solutions with electronic verification, workflow automation, and document management
- Leverage professional body templates for initial program development to reduce upfront costs
- Consider manual processes only if designated service volume is very low (<10 customers/year) and all are low-risk

**For Small to Medium Firms**:
- Comprehensive AML software is essential—manual processes don't scale and create significant compliance risk
- Prioritize solutions integrating with existing practice management systems to reduce dual entry
- Budget for software ($1,200-$5,000/year depending on tier), electronic verification, and staff training
- Consider the compliance officer role as a part-time responsibility for a senior staff member rather than full-time hire

**For Large Firms**:
- Enterprise-grade software with advanced features (transaction monitoring, sophisticated risk scoring, reporting analytics) justified by volume and complexity
- Dedicated compliance officer essential; software enables them to manage compliance effectively
- Integration with existing systems critical—standalone solutions create workflow friction at scale
- Budget for software ($5,000-$20,000+/year), dedicated staff, and external independent reviews

**Universal Principles**:
- Technology enables compliance, but doesn't replace human judgment for suspicion detection, customer relationships, and program design
- Early adoption (well before July 2026 deadline) allows time to refine processes and train staff without deadline pressure
- Choosing the right solution is critical—consult AUSTRAC, professional bodies, and peers before committing
- ROI extends beyond time savings to include risk reduction, which can be quantified by considering even small probabilities of penalties or enforcement actions
