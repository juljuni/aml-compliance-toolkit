  - Trust formation, operation, or management? ✓ Designated
  - Buying or selling a business entity? ✓ Designated
  - Real estate transaction assistance? ✓ Designated
  - Tax return preparation only? ✗ NOT designated

- Practice management software (with retention rules)

**Must Ensure:**
- Records are secure from unauthorized access
- Records are retrievable if AUSTRAC requests
- Records are readable and auditable
- Backup systems in place

**Destruction After 7 Years:**
- Only destroy after full 7 years elapsed
- Document destruction (destruction log)
- Use secure destruction method (shredding, electronic deletion)

**Time Impact:** ⏱️
- Setting up retention: +10-15 minutes per client
- Ongoing storage: minimal (part of normal archiving)
- Retrieval (if AUSTRAC requests): +1-4 hours

**Documentation Required:** 📋
- Retention schedule showing 7-year end date
- Archive location/system
- Destruction log (after 7 years)

**Risk:** ⚠️
- Destroying records early = compliance breach
- Unable to retrieve records during AUSTRAC audit = serious issue

## TOTAL COST IMPACT CALCULATION

### Small Firm Example (5 staff, 30 designated service clients/year)

**Assumptions:**
- Average staff cost: $75/hour (including overheads)
- Average case complexity: Simple to moderate
- Using FREE AUSTRAC Starter Kit (manual processes)
- Average onboarding time: 2.5 hours per client

**Initial Year Costs (2026-2027):**

**Program Setup (One-Time):**
- Template customization: 40 hours × $75 = $3,000
- Staff training: 20 hours × $75 = $1,500
- Transitioning existing clients (20 clients): 20 × 2 hours = 40 hours × $75 = $3,000
- **Total Setup:** $7,500

**Ongoing Per Client:**
- New client onboarding: 30 clients × 2.5 hours × $75 = $5,625
- OCDD reviews (assuming 1/3 of clients due): 10 clients × 30 min × $75 = $375
- **Total Ongoing:** $6,000

**First Year Total:** $13,500

**Subsequent Years:**
- New clients: 30 × 2.5 hours × $75 = $5,625
- OCDD reviews: 10 × 30 min × $75 = $375
- **Annual Ongoing:** $6,000/year

---

- Average onboarding time: 1.5 hours (with automation)

**Initial Year Costs:**

**Program Setup:**
- Software procurement and setup: $10,000
- Template customization: 60 hours × $85 = $5,100
- Staff training: 80 hours × $85 = $6,800
- Transitioning existing clients (100 clients): 100 × 1.5 hours × $85 = $12,750
- **Total Setup:** $34,650

**Ongoing Per Client:**
- New clients: 150 × 1.5 hours × $85 = $19,125
- OCDD reviews (50 clients): 50 × 30 min × $85 = $2,125
- Software subscription: $5,000
- **Total Ongoing:** $26,250

## KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Front-Load Your Investment

**Recommendation:**
- Invest heavily in setup (February-June 2026)
- Create robust templates and workflows upfront
- Train staff thoroughly before July 1, 2026
- Use transition period wisely (3 years for existing clients)

**Why:**
- Initial setup is most time-intensive
- Once systems in place, ongoing costs manageable
- Spreading existing client CDD over 3 years reduces burden

---

### 2. Automation Pays Off at Scale

**Break-Even Analysis:**

**Automation Cost:** $5,000/year
**Time Saved Per Client:** ~1 hour
**Staff Cost:** $75/hour

**Break-Even Point:** 67 clients/year

**Conclusion:**
- Firms with 70+ designated service clients/year should invest in automation
- Firms with <50 clients can manage manually
- 50-70 clients: marginal, depends on complexity

---

### 3. Complexity Drives Cost

**Simple clients** (individuals, Australian, standard services): 2-3 hours
**Complex clients** (trusts, multi-tier companies, PEPs, high-risk): 5-10+ hours

**Recommendation:**
- Consider pricing designated services to reflect AML costs
- Build AML time into engagement budgets
- For complex structures: Quote separately for AML compliance component
- Consider declining very high-risk clients if cost/risk not justified

---

### 4. Prioritize High-Risk Existing Clients

**3-Year Transition Strategy:**

**Year 1 (2026-2027):**
- All new clients (full CDD before service)
- Existing high-risk clients (PEPs, complex structures, high-value)

**Year 2 (2027-2028):**
- Existing medium-risk clients

**Year 3 (2028-2029):**
- Existing low-risk clients
- Complete all remaining clients before June 30, 2029

**Why:**
- Regulatory expectation to prioritize risk
- Reduces compliance risk early
- Spreads workload over 3 years

---

### 5. Client Experience Considerations

**AML Requirements Impact Clients:**
- More information requested than previously
- Documents required (ID, proof of address, etc.)
- Delays in service commencement (if CDD incomplete)
- May feel intrusive or burdensome

**Recommendations:**
- **Communicate proactively:** Explain AML obligations in engagement letter
- **Set expectations:** Tell clients what documents needed upfront
- **Streamline process:** Use electronic forms, online portals if possible
- **Professional presentation:** Make CDD process feel secure and professional, not bureaucratic
- **Educate clients:** Explain why AML important (protecting financial system)

---

### 6. Staff Training is Critical

**Training Needed:**

**All Staff:**
- Overview of AML/CTF obligations
- How to identify designated services
- Tipping-off prohibition
- Red flags and suspicious activity
- When to escalate to Compliance Officer

**Client-Facing Staff:**
- Customer onboarding procedures
- How to collect CDD information
- How to verify identity
- How to explain AML to clients professionally

**Compliance Officer:**
- In-depth AML/CTF knowledge
- Risk assessment methodology
- SMR preparation and filing
- AUSTRAC reporting systems
- Record keeping requirements

**Frequency:**
- Initial training: Before July 1, 2026
- Refresher training: Annually
- Ad-hoc training: When regulations change

**Time Investment:**
- Initial: 4-8 hours per staff member
- Annual refresher: 2-4 hours

## CONCLUSION

AML/CTF compliance creates **significant additional work** at every stage of the client onboarding process and throughout the client relationship. The key impacts are:

1. **Initial Onboarding:** 2-10 hours per client (vs. ~30 minutes previously)
2. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Periodic reviews every 1-5 years (new obligation)
3. **Record Keeping:** 7-year retention (vs. standard 5-year accounting records)
4. **Risk Management:** Continuous monitoring for red flags (new obligation)
5. **Reporting:** SMRs if suspicious activity detected (new obligation)

**Success Factors:**
- Invest in setup and templates upfront
- Train staff thoroughly
- Consider automation for firms with 50+ designated service clients
- Build AML costs into pricing
- Prioritize high-risk existing clients during transition
- Communicate professionally with clients about requirements

**Bottom Line:**
AML compliance is a **material cost increase** for accounting firms providing designated services, but with proper planning and systems, it can be managed efficiently and become part of normal business operations.
