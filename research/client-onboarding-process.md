# Client Onboarding Process for AML/CTF Compliance

## Overview of the Onboarding Workflow

Client onboarding under the AML/CTF framework involves a structured, sequential process that must be completed before providing designated services. The workflow ensures firms know who their clients are, understand the risks they present, and collect sufficient information to monitor the relationship over time.

The process differs significantly from traditional accounting firm onboarding, which might simply involve an engagement letter and fee agreement. AML/CTF onboarding is more rigorous, time-consuming, and documented, similar to the processes banks follow when opening new accounts.

## Step-by-Step Onboarding Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Client Contact and Service Determination

**Objective**: Determine whether the requested service is a designated service that triggers AML/CTF obligations.

**Actions**:
1. Document the nature of service requested by the prospective client
2. Assess whether the service constitutes a designated service under the AML/CTF Act:
   - Creating or managing trusts
   - Forming or managing companies, partnerships, or associations
   - Acting as an ASIC agent
   - Certain high-value financial transactions involving real property or business entities

3. If the service is NOT a designated service (e.g., tax return preparation, BAS lodgment, general bookkeeping), proceed with standard engagement processes—AML/CTF obligations do not apply

4. If the service IS a designated service, proceed with full AML/CTF customer due diligence before providing the service

**Key Consideration**: Many accounting services fall outside designated services. Carefully categorize each engagement to avoid unnecessary compliance burden while ensuring obligations are met when required.

### Step 2: Collect Customer Information

**Objective**: Gather sufficient information to establish the customer's identity, understand their circumstances, and assess risk.

#### For Individual Customers

Collect:
- Full legal name (including any former names)
- Date of birth
- Residential address (not a PO Box—must be a physical address where the person can be located)
- Occupation
- Contact details (phone, email)
- Purpose of the service being requested
- Expected nature and frequency of transactions

#### For Company Customers

Collect:
- Full registered company name
- Australian Company Number (ACN)
- Australian Business Number (ABN)
- Registered office address
- Principal place of business (if different from registered office)
- Company type (proprietary, public, limited by guarantee, etc.)
- Nature of business activities
- Directors' details
- Shareholders/beneficial owners (natural persons owning 25% or more)
- Purpose of the service being requested

#### For Trust Customers

Collect:
- Trust name
- Trust type (discretionary, unit, hybrid, charitable, etc.)
- Date of establishment
- ABN or TFN (if applicable)
- Copy of trust deed or equivalent establishing document
- Trustee details (individual or corporate trustee)
- Settlor details
- Beneficiaries (including classes of beneficiaries for discretionary trusts)
- Appointor or guardian details
- Beneficial owners (natural persons who ultimately control the trust)
- Purpose of the trust and the designated service requested

#### For Partnership Customers

Collect:
- Partnership name
- ABN
- Principal place of business
- Partnership agreement (if formal agreement exists)
- Details of all partners
- Beneficial owners (natural persons owning 25% or more interest)
- Nature of partnership business
- Purpose of the service being requested

**Method of Collection**:
Information can be collected through:
- Face-to-face meetings
- Online forms or client portals
- Email or postal correspondence
- Video conferencing
- Telephone (though visual verification is preferable for identity documents)

### Step 3: Verify Customer Identity

**Objective**: Confirm the customer is who they claim to be using reliable, independent sources.

Verification must occur before providing the designated service. The standard is "reliable and independent"—meaning sources that are difficult to forge, come from authoritative third parties, and can be verified against multiple data points.

#### Verification Methods for Individuals

**Document Verification**:

Acceptable primary identification documents include:
- Current Australian driver's license with photo
- Australian passport (current or expired within preceding 2 years)
- National identity card issued by a foreign government with photo and signature
- Foreign passport (current or expired within preceding 2 years)

From the primary document, record:
- Full name as shown on the document
- Date of birth
- Document number and issuing authority
- Document expiry date
- Whether you sighted the original, certified copy, or digital version

If a primary photographic identity document cannot be obtained, collect:
- Birth certificate or citizenship certificate, PLUS
- Notice issued by a government agency (e.g., Centrelink, ATO notice of assessment) within the preceding 12 months showing name and residential address

**Electronic Verification**:

Use an electronic verification service that:
- Accesses government or reliable commercial databases
- Matches at least three independent data sources
- Provides a verification result and audit trail

Common electronic verification services in Australia:
- DVS (Document Verification Service) for driver's licenses and passports
- Equifax, Illion, or Experian identity verification solutions
- ASIC company searches for company officeholders

Electronic verification is faster and more efficient than document collection, particularly for remote onboarding.

**Certification**:

If you cannot sight original documents, acceptable certification includes:
- Justice of the Peace
- Legal practitioner
- Accountant (CPA, CA, or member of IPA)
- Police officer
- Australia Post officer (when using their certification service)

The certifier must sight the original document, confirm it is a true copy, provide their name, qualification, registration number (if applicable), and signature.

#### Verification Methods for Companies

**ASIC Company Search**:
- Conduct a current company extract from ASIC showing:
  - Registered company name and ACN
  - Registration date
  - Registered office and principal place of business
  - Company type and status (registered, under administration, etc.)
  - Directors and secretaries
  - Shareholdings (if publicly available)

**ABN Lookup**:
- Verify the company's ABN and trading names via the Australian Business Register

**Director and Beneficial Owner Verification**:
- Identify natural persons who are directors or hold 25%+ ownership
- Verify these individuals' identities using the methods described above for individuals

#### Verification Methods for Trusts

**Trust Deed Review**:
- Obtain and review the original or certified copy of the trust deed
- Verify the trust name, establishment date, settlor, original trustee, and governing provisions

**Trustee Verification**:
- If individual trustee: verify identity using individual methods
- If corporate trustee: verify using company verification methods, then verify the identity of directors/beneficial owners of the corporate trustee

**Beneficial Owner Identification**:

For trusts, beneficial ownership is complex:
- Appointors or guardians (persons who can appoint or remove trustees)
- Settlors (if they retain influence over the trust)
- Beneficiaries (for fixed trusts, verify beneficiaries with significant entitlements; for discretionary trusts, verify any named beneficiaries who are certain to benefit and the class definitions)
- Controllers (any person who can direct distributions or vary the trust deed)

Verify the identity of natural persons meeting beneficial ownership criteria.

### Step 4: Beneficial Ownership Identification and Verification

**Objective**: Identify and verify the natural persons who ultimately own or control the customer.

The 25% threshold is a bright-line rule: any natural person owning or controlling 25% or more of a customer entity is a beneficial owner requiring identification and verification.

**Control Beyond Ownership**:
Even if no single person owns 25%+, identify persons who:
- Exercise control through voting rights disproportionate to ownership
- Have the power to appoint or remove directors or trustees
- Can veto significant decisions
- Exercise de facto control through other arrangements

**Examples**:

*Example 1 - Company with 4 Equal Shareholders*:
- Customer: ABC Pty Ltd
- Shareholders: Anna (25%), Bob (25%), Chen (25%), Diana (25%)
- Beneficial owners requiring verification: All four shareholders (each meets 25% threshold)

*Example 2 - Company with Dispersed Ownership*:
- Customer: XYZ Pty Ltd
- Shareholders: 10 individuals, each holding 10%
- No individual meets 25% threshold
- Identify who controls the company (e.g., managing director with operational control, or shareholders' agreement that gives certain persons veto rights)
- If no single natural person exercises control, document this and verify the identity of senior managing official(s)

*Example 3 - Discretionary Family Trust*:
- Customer: Smith Family Trust
- Trustee: Smith Family Pty Ltd
- Directors of corporate trustee: John Smith, Mary Smith
- Appointor: John Smith
- Beneficiaries: Discretionary class (John, Mary, and their children)
- Beneficial owners requiring verification:
  - John Smith (appointor and director—exercises control)
  - Mary Smith (director of corporate trustee)
  - Potentially John and Mary as primary beneficiaries (if they are the only beneficiaries likely to receive distributions)

**Verification Requirement**:
Once beneficial owners are identified, verify their identities using the same methods applied to the customer (government ID, electronic verification, etc.).

### Step 5: Risk Assessment

**Objective**: Assign a risk rating to the customer to determine the level of ongoing due diligence and monitoring required.

#### Risk Rating Categories

**Low Risk**:
- Individual client resident in Australia
- Straightforward service (e.g., establishing a simple family trust for estate planning)
- No connections to high-risk jurisdictions
- Occupation and source of funds are clear and consistent with known information
- No adverse media or regulatory concerns

**Medium Risk**:
- Australian company with standard corporate structure
- Business activities that are common and well-understood
- Some complexity in ownership or operations but nothing indicative of higher risk
- No significant red flags

**High Risk** (triggers Enhanced Customer Due Diligence):
- Foreign politically exposed person (PEP) or associate of a PEP
- Customer from or doing business in high-risk jurisdiction
- Cash-intensive business
- Complex ownership structure designed to obscure beneficial ownership (e.g., multiple layers of offshore companies and trusts)
- Customer reluctant to provide information or provides inconsistent information
- Adverse media indicating potential involvement in financial crime, corruption, or sanctions
- Industry sectors with higher ML/TF risk (e.g., money services, casinos, cryptocurrency exchanges, arms dealers, precious metals)

#### Risk Assessment Process

1. **Evaluate risk factors** present for this customer:
   - Customer type and location
   - Nature of business or source of wealth
   - Ownership and control structure
   - Jurisdictions involved
   - Delivery channel (face-to-face vs. remote)
   - PEP status
   - Adverse information

2. **Balance risk factors** to reach an overall risk rating (low, medium, or high)

3. **Document the risk assessment**:
   - Which risk factors are present
   - Why the overall risk rating was assigned
   - Who conducted the assessment and when
   - Any mitigating factors considered

4. **Obtain appropriate approval**:
   - Low and medium risk: standard approval by person conducting onboarding
   - High risk: require senior management or compliance officer approval before proceeding

### Step 6: Enhanced Due Diligence for High-Risk Customers

If the customer is assessed as high risk, apply enhanced measures before providing the service:

**Additional Information to Collect**:
- **Source of Wealth**: How the customer accumulated their overall assets and financial position (e.g., "inheritance from parents' estate," "sale of business built over 20 years," "salary and savings from employment as a software engineer")
- **Source of Funds**: Where the money for this specific transaction or service came from (e.g., "proceeds from sale of investment property at 123 Main St," "loan from ABC Bank," "distribution from XYZ Trust")
- **Purpose and Intended Nature of Relationship**: Detailed understanding of why they are engaging your services, what they intend to achieve, and expected transaction patterns
- **Enhanced Beneficial Ownership Investigation**: Deeper inquiry into complex ownership chains or nominee arrangements

**Additional Verification**:
- Independent corroboration of source of wealth/funds (e.g., bank statements, sale contracts, loan agreements, tax returns)
- Verification of PEP status through databases or reliable media sources
- Sanctions screening against DFAT sanctions lists, UN lists, and international sanctions databases

**Senior Management Approval**:
- High-risk relationships require approval from a senior manager or compliance officer
- Document the approval decision, including consideration of risks and mitigating controls

**Enhanced Ongoing Monitoring**:
- More frequent reviews (e.g., every 6-12 months rather than only when triggered by events)
- Closer scrutiny of transactions and activities
- Heightened sensitivity to red flags or suspicious activity

### Step 7: Document Collection and Retention

**Objective**: Securely store all information and documents collected during onboarding.

Collect and retain:
- Completed customer information forms
- Copies of identification documents (or electronic verification results)
- Trust deeds, company constitutions, partnership agreements
- Beneficial ownership charts or diagrams for complex structures
- Risk assessment documentation
- Approval records (especially for high-risk customers)
- Correspondence with the customer
- Source of funds/wealth documentation (for high-risk customers)

**Retention Period**: 7 years from the end of the customer relationship

**Security**: Records containing personal information must be stored securely, with access restricted to authorized personnel, consistent with Privacy Act obligations.

### Step 8: Provide Service

Once all customer due diligence is complete, risk assessment is documented, and (for high-risk customers) enhanced measures are applied and senior management approval is obtained, you may provide the designated service.

**Do NOT provide the service before completing these steps**. Doing so is a breach of the AML/CTF Act and exposes the firm to penalties.

### Step 9: Record Onboarding in Systems

**Objective**: Ensure customer information is accessible for ongoing monitoring and reporting.

Enter the customer information into:
- Client management system or CRM
- AML/CTF compliance software (if separate from client management system)
- Document management system

Tag or categorize the client:
- As a customer subject to AML/CTF obligations
- With their assigned risk rating
- With key dates (onboarding date, next review date)
- With flags for any special considerations (PEP, high-risk jurisdiction, etc.)

This enables efficient ongoing monitoring and ensures the client is included in compliance reporting and reviews.

## Information That Must Be Collected

### Minimum Information Requirements

| Customer Type | Required Information |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Individual | Full name, date of birth, residential address, occupation |
| Company | Registered name, ACN, ABN, registered office, principal place of business, directors, beneficial owners (25%+) |
| Trust | Trust name, type, ABN/TFN, trust deed, trustee, settlor, beneficiaries, appointor, beneficial owners |
| Partnership | Partnership name, ABN, principal place of business, partners, beneficial owners (25%+) |

### Additional Information for High-Risk Customers

- Source of wealth
- Source of funds for specific transactions
- Detailed business activities and financial profile
- Relationships with high-risk jurisdictions
- PEP status and position details
- Adverse media or regulatory history

## Verification Methods Required

Australian AML/CTF law specifies verification must be conducted using reliable and independent sources. The following methods meet this standard:

### Reliable and Independent Sources

**Government-issued documents**:
- Driver's licenses, passports, national identity cards
- Birth certificates, citizenship certificates
- Government agency notices (ATO, Centrelink, Medicare)

**Government databases**:
- ASIC company searches
- ABN lookups
- DVS (Document Verification Service) for driver's licenses and passports

**Reputable commercial databases**:
- Credit bureau identity verification services (Equifax, Illion, Experian)
- International sanctions and PEP screening databases (World-Check, Dow Jones, ComplyAdvantage)

**Original or certified documents**:
- Trust deeds (original or lawyer-certified copies)
- Company registers and minute books
- Partnership agreements

### Unacceptable Sources

The following do NOT constitute reliable and independent verification:
- Information provided by the customer without independent confirmation
- Social media profiles
- Business cards or letterhead
- Utility bills alone (acceptable as secondary evidence of address, but not primary identity verification)
- References from associates or business partners
- Wikipedia or unreliable online sources

## Risk Assessment Criteria

### Customer Risk Factors

- **Type**: Individual (lower risk), company (medium), trust/complex structure (potentially higher)
- **Location**: Australian resident (lower), foreign resident (higher), connection to high-risk jurisdiction (high)
- **Occupation/Industry**: Standard professions (lower), cash-intensive or high-risk industries (higher), PEPs (high)
- **Behavior**: Cooperative and transparent (lower), reluctant to provide information (higher), inconsistent explanations (high)

### Product/Service Risk Factors

- **Complexity**: Simple structure (lower), multi-layered ownership (higher)
- **Jurisdiction**: Domestic only (lower), involves foreign jurisdictions (medium to high depending on jurisdiction)
- **Anonymity**: Clear ownership (lower), nominees or bearer shares (high)

### Delivery Channel Risk Factors

- **In-person**: Lower risk (easier to verify identity and assess demeanor)
- **Remote/online**: Medium risk (harder to verify authenticity of documents)
- **Intermediary/third party**: Higher risk (relationship with ultimate customer is less direct)

### Geographic Risk Factors

High-risk jurisdictions include those with:
- Weak AML/CTF controls
- High levels of corruption
- Subject to international sanctions (e.g., Iran, North Korea, Russia)
- Designated by FATF as having strategic deficiencies

AUSTRAC provides guidance on high-risk jurisdictions. Examples historically include certain jurisdictions in Central Asia, Middle East, and some offshore financial centers.

## Documentation Requirements

### Documents to Retain for Each Customer

1. **Customer Information Form**: Structured record of all information collected during onboarding
2. **Identification Documents**: Copies of driver's license, passport, or certification of these documents
3. **Verification Evidence**: ASIC searches, electronic verification reports, ABN lookups
4. **Entity Documents**: Trust deeds, company constitutions, partnership agreements
5. **Beneficial Ownership Documentation**: Ownership charts, shareholder registers, declarations
6. **Risk Assessment**: Documented evaluation of risk factors and assigned risk rating
7. **Approval Records**: Senior management approval for high-risk customers
8. **Enhanced Due Diligence Records**: Source of wealth/funds verification, additional inquiries, sanctions screening results
9. **Correspondence**: Emails, letters, file notes from conversations with the customer during onboarding

### Retention and Accessibility

- All documents must be retained for 7 years from the end of the customer relationship
- Must be readily accessible if AUSTRAC requests them during an audit or investigation
- Electronic storage is acceptable and recommended for searchability
- Implement appropriate security to protect personal information
- Maintain version control and audit trails for any updates to customer information
