## 10 Strategic Questions for Your Meeting

### 1. Understanding Their Client Base & Scope

**Question:**
> "Walk me through your typical client work. Of your current clients, how many do you help with things like setting up companies, creating trusts, restructuring business entities, or buying/selling businesses? I'm trying to understand what percentage of your practice will be caught by the new AML rules versus just tax returns and bookkeeping."

**What You're Really Asking:**
- How big is their AML problem? (# of designated service clients)
- Are they aware of which services trigger obligations?
- What's their growth trajectory for designated services?

**Listen For:**
- Specific numbers: "We do about 30-40 company setups per year"
- Uncertainty: "I'm not sure which services count" (opportunity to educate)
- Growth plans: "We're trying to expand into more advisory work" (growing problem)
- Mix of services: High designated service % = bigger pain point

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "How many of those are new clients versus existing clients each year?"
- "Are you planning to expand or reduce these types of services given the AML burden?"
- "How many of those involve trusts or complex structures?" (complexity indicator)

**Why This Matters:**
- Validates market size for them specifically
- Determines if they're above/below automation break-even (~67 clients/year)
- Shows if they understand scope (many don't yet)

### 2. Their Current State of Preparation

**Question:**
> "Where are you in your AML compliance preparation right now? Have you downloaded the AUSTRAC starter kit, looked at any software, assigned someone to be your compliance officer? What's been the hardest part of getting ready so far?"

**What You're Really Asking:**
- How prepared are they? (prospects closer to deadline are more motivated buyers)
- What obstacles have they hit?
- What solutions have they already evaluated?

**Listen For:**
- "We haven't started yet" (procrastinators - may panic-buy later)
- "We downloaded the starter kit but it's overwhelming" (perfect prospect - needs help)
- "We're looking at [specific software]" (competitive intelligence)
- "We can't find anything affordable" (validates your market gap)
- "Our compliance officer quit because they were overwhelmed" (pain point)

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What made the starter kit overwhelming - was it the volume of work or understanding what to do?"
- "What software have you looked at? What made you not move forward?"
- "Who did you assign as compliance officer? How do they feel about it?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Identifies where they are in buying cycle (awareness → consideration → decision)
- Reveals specific pain points you can solve
- Shows what competitors they've seen (and rejected)

### 3. Time Impact Deep Dive

**Question:**
> "Let's say you onboard a new client tomorrow who wants help setting up a family trust. Walk me through every step you'd need to take for AML compliance - from the initial conversation to when you can actually start the trust work. How long do you think each step would take with the manual AUSTRAC templates?"

**What You're Really Asking:**
- Do they understand the workflow?
- Have they quantified the time burden?
- Which specific steps cause the most pain?

**Listen For:**
- Detailed understanding vs. vague: "I think we just need to check their ID?" (education opportunity)
- Time estimates: Compare to your research (2-10 hours)
- Specific pain points: "The beneficial ownership stuff sounds really complicated"
- Bottlenecks: "We'd have to wait for documents from the client"
- Manual steps: "I guess we'd use a spreadsheet to track it all?"

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Which parts of that process would you most want to automate if you could?"
- "How would this impact your ability to take on new clients?"
- "What happens if someone on your team forgets a step?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Validates your workflow research (03-client-onboarding-workflow.md)
- Identifies highest-value automation opportunities
- Quantifies time cost (hours × hourly rate = $ value)
- Shows process maturity and understanding

---

### 4. The Existing Client Transition Problem

**Question:**
> "You've got a 3-year window to get all your existing clients through the AML process. Let's say you have 200 total clients, and 100 of them get designated services. How are you planning to work through that backlog while also handling new clients and your normal workload? What worries you most about that transition?"

**What You're Really Asking:**
- Have they thought through the transition logistics?
- What's their strategy (or lack thereof)?
- What would help them manage the 3-year crunch?

**Listen For:**
- "I haven't thought about that" (common - creates urgency when you explain it)
- "We're planning to hire someone just for AML" (expensive solution - your software is cheaper)
- "We'll just spread it out evenly" (unrealistic - need risk-based prioritization)
- "We might need to stop taking new clients during busy season" (revenue impact)
- Anxiety about missing the 2029 deadline

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "If you could automate the review scheduling and reminders, would that help?"
- "What if you had a system that prioritized which existing clients to do first based on risk?"
- "How will you track which clients are done and which still need to be completed?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Existing client transition is a huge, under-discussed problem
- OCDD reminder/scheduling feature is high-value
- Creates sense of urgency (3 years sounds far but it's not)
- Validates need for tracking/project management features

### 5. Risk & Liability Concerns

**Question:**
> "The penalties for getting this wrong are pretty severe - up to $37.8 million for serious breaches, and almost $19,000 per day if you're not enrolled on time. What keeps you up at night about AML compliance? Is it more the time burden, the complexity of getting it right, or the risk of making a mistake?"

**What You're Really Asking:**
- What's their primary pain point: time, complexity, or risk?
- How risk-averse are they?
- Would they pay for peace of mind?

**Listen For:**
- "The penalties terrify me" (risk-averse - will pay for compliance assurance)
- "I'm more worried about the time" (efficiency-focused - will pay for automation)
- "I don't really understand what we're supposed to do" (education needed)
- "What if AUSTRAC audits us and our records aren't good enough?" (documentation anxiety)
- "I'm worried my staff will make mistakes" (process enforcement need)

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "If there was a system that wouldn't let you start work on a client until their AML checks were complete, would that give you peace of mind?"
- "Would you pay more for a solution that guarantees audit-ready documentation?"
- "How would you feel about a compliance checklist that your team has to complete before any designated service?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Different buyers have different primary motivations (time vs. risk vs. complexity)
- Risk-averse buyers pay more for compliance features
- Workflow enforcement is a differentiating feature (vs. just templates)
- Reveals pricing psychology

### 6. Current Solution Evaluation

**Question:**
> "I know there's the free AUSTRAC starter kit, and then there's enterprise software that costs $5,000 to $50,000 per year. Have you looked at either of those? What made you choose or not choose them? If there was something in between - say $200 to $700 per month - that automated the most painful parts, would that be interesting?"

**What You're Really Asking:**
- What's their budget range?
- Why haven't they chosen existing options?
- Does your pricing range resonate?

**Listen For:**
- "The free kit is too manual for us" (perfect)
- "The enterprise software is way too expensive" (perfect)
- "$700/month is still too much" (price ceiling - probe further)
- "$200/month sounds reasonable" (price floor validated)
- "We'd pay more if it really works" (value-focused buyer)
- "We're just going to use the free kit" (not a qualified prospect - that's OK)

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What would a $500/month solution need to do to be worth it for you?"
- "If it saved you 50 hours per year, what's that worth to you?" (quantify time × rate)
- "Would you rather pay per client processed or a flat monthly fee?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Direct pricing validation
- Confirms your market gap hypothesis
- Reveals pricing model preferences (subscription vs. per-transaction)
- Identifies price sensitivity and value perception

### 7. The Tech Stack & Integration Question

**Question:**
> "What practice management software do you currently use - Xero Practice Manager, MYOB, CCH, something else? And how do you currently manage client onboarding and document collection? I'm curious if you'd want AML compliance to integrate with your existing tools or if you'd prefer a standalone solution."

**What You're Really Asking:**
- What integration opportunities exist?
- How tech-savvy are they?
- What's their current workflow?

**Listen For:**
- Specific software names (integration priorities)
- "We mostly use spreadsheets and email" (low-tech - need simple UX)
- "Everything's in [Practice Management System]" (integration is valuable)
- "We use [Document Management System]" (integration opportunity)
- "Our systems don't talk to each other" (integration is painful - they understand the value)

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "If AML compliance could pull client information from [their PM system], would that save you time?"
- "Would you want AML documents stored in your existing document management system or separate?"
- "How do you currently send forms to clients - email, portal, paper?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Informs MVP scope (standalone vs. integrated)
- Identifies partnership opportunities (PM software providers)
- Reveals technical sophistication (impacts UX design)
- Integration can be a major value-add or nice-to-have depending on their setup

### 8. Team Dynamics & Training

**Question:**
> "Who on your team will actually be doing the day-to-day AML work - checking IDs, filling out forms, tracking reviews? How comfortable are they with new software and processes? And how much training time can you realistically allocate to getting them up to speed?"

**What You're Really Asking:**
- Who are the actual users (not just the buyer)?
- What's their technical proficiency?
- How much onboarding/training can you expect them to tolerate?

**Listen For:**
- "Probably our admin staff" (need very simple UX)
- "Our senior accountants will do it" (can handle more complexity)
- "We'll hire someone specifically for AML" (different buyer persona)
- "My team hates learning new software" (simplicity is critical)
- "They're pretty tech-savvy" (can handle richer features)
- "We don't have time for training" (need intuitive, self-service onboarding)

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "If the software had built-in guidance at each step, would that help?"
- "Would you want video tutorials, written guides, or live training?"
- "How long did it take your team to learn your current practice management system?"

**Why This Matters:**
- End users ≠ buyer (design for users, sell to buyer)
- Informs UX complexity (simple wizard vs. power-user features)
- Training/onboarding is a real cost (impacts adoption)
- Can be a differentiator (built-in guidance vs. generic software)

---

### 9. Network & Referral Potential

**Question:**
> "Do you know other accounting firms around your size who are facing the same AML challenge? Are you part of any practice groups, networks, or industry associations where people talk about compliance? I'm curious if this is something firms are discussing with each other or if everyone's just figuring it out alone."

**What You're Really Asking:**
- What's the referral potential?
- Are there network effects we can leverage?
- Where do they get information and recommendations?

**Listen For:**
- "We have a monthly peer group meeting" (warm referral channel)
- "Everyone in our CPA/CA ANZ chapter is freaking out about this" (marketing opportunity)
- "I have 3-4 firm owner friends I talk to regularly" (initial customer acquisition strategy)
- "There's a Facebook group for small firm owners" (community marketing)
- Specific network names (associations, mastermind groups, etc.)

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Would you be willing to introduce me to 2-3 other firm owners if this solution works for you?"
- "If you found a great AML solution, would you share it with your peer group?"
- "Are there any industry events coming up where firm owners will be discussing AML?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Small firm owners trust peer recommendations >> advertising
- Network effects can accelerate customer acquisition
- Identifies marketing channels (associations, events, communities)
- Validates word-of-mouth potential
- Could inform referral/partnership pricing model

### 10. The "Build vs. Buy vs. Suffer" Decision

**Question:**
> "Looking at your options - you could use the free manual templates, you could pay for expensive enterprise software, you could try to build something in-house with spreadsheets and your practice management system, or you could just try to get through it and hope for the best. What's your current plan, and what would make you change that plan? What would an ideal solution look like for a firm your size?"

**What You're Really Asking:**
- What's their current intention?
- What would trigger a purchase decision?
- What features define "ideal" for them?

**Listen For:**
- "We're going to try the manual approach first and see how it goes" (wait-and-see - need urgency)
- "We're hoping someone builds something for small firms" (perfect - that's you!)
- "We're just going to hire a temp or consultant" (expensive alternative)
- Their feature wish list (product roadmap input)
- Decision triggers: "If I could see it working for another firm like mine..."

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What would have to go wrong with the manual approach for you to pay for software?"
- "If I could show you a working system in another accounting firm, would you want to see it?"
- "What features are absolute must-haves versus nice-to-haves?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Reveals purchase intent and timeline
- Identifies decision criteria (features, price, proof, etc.)
- Shows what they'd pay for vs. what they'd do manually
- Uncovers deal-breakers and must-haves
- Informs MVP feature set (must-haves first)

- Move to **Q2** (current preparation) - shows you understand their world

### Middle (Pain Point Deep Dive)
- **Q3** (time impact) - make them feel the pain viscerally
- **Q4** (existing client transition) - introduce a problem they may not have considered
- **Q5** (risk & liability) - emotional hook (fear/anxiety)

### Solution Exploration
- **Q6** (current solutions) - direct pricing discussion
- **Q7** (tech stack) - practical implementation talk
- **Q8** (team dynamics) - reality check on adoption

### Closing (Expansion & Commitment)
- **Q9** (network) - expand opportunity beyond this one firm
- **Q10** (build vs. buy) - close with their ideal scenario and decision criteria

## How to Use These Questions

### Don't Ask All 10 Rigidly
- This is a **conversation guide**, not an interrogation
- Let them talk, follow interesting threads
- You may only get through 5-6 questions in 30-45 minutes - that's OK

### Listen More Than Talk
- 80/20 rule: They talk 80%, you talk 20%
- Resist urge to pitch or explain your solution
- Take notes on exact phrases they use (their words = your marketing copy)

### Probe the "Why" Behind Answers
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What makes that particularly challenging?"
- "Can you give me an example?"

### Quantify Everything
- Time: "How many hours?"
- Money: "What would that cost?"
- Scale: "How many clients?"
- Frequency: "How often?"

### Watch for Emotional Responses
- Anxiety, frustration, fear = real pain points
- Excitement about potential solution = genuine interest
- Indifference = not a real problem for them (that's OK to learn)

### End with Permission to Follow Up
- "This has been incredibly helpful. Would you be open to me showing you what we build based on feedback like yours?"
- "Can I check back in with you in a month as we develop this?"
- "Would you be willing to be an early beta tester if we build this?"

## What Success Looks Like

### Strong Signals (Good Prospect)
- ✅ 50+ designated service clients/year
- ✅ "The free starter kit is too manual"
- ✅ "Enterprise software is too expensive"
- ✅ Willing to pay $200-700/month range
- ✅ Has tried and rejected alternatives
- ✅ Expresses anxiety about compliance risk
- ✅ Can introduce you to peer network
- ✅ Asks "when will this be available?"

### Weak Signals (Not a Good Prospect - Yet)
- ⚠️ <20 designated service clients/year (too small)
- ⚠️ "We'll just use the free kit" (satisfied with manual)
- ⚠️ "We're going to stop offering those services" (shrinking market)
- ⚠️ No urgency, procrastinating
- ⚠️ Expects it to be free or very cheap
- ⚠️ Already committed to enterprise solution

### Key Insights to Capture
1. **Specific time estimates** for each workflow step (validate your research)
2. **Exact pricing feedback** on $200-700/month range
3. **Feature priorities** (what they'd pay for vs. nice-to-have)
4. **Competitive intelligence** (what else they've looked at and why they rejected it)
5. **Referral names** (2-3 other firm owners you can talk to)
6. **Objections** (what would prevent them from buying)
7. **Decision timeline** (when do they need to decide)

## Bonus: The "Test Close" Question

If the conversation is going really well and they seem like a strong prospect:

**Question:**
> "Hypothetically, if we built a solution that [addresses their specific pain points you've discussed], automated [the specific steps they said were most painful], and cost around [price they indicated was reasonable] per month, would you want to be one of the first firms to try it? I'm looking for 3-5 firms to work with closely as we build this."

**What You're Testing:**
- Actual buying intent (vs. hypothetical interest)
- Whether they'll commit time/energy (not just money)
- If they're willing to be an early adopter (implies real pain)

**Good Responses:**
- "Yes, absolutely"
- "Can I see a demo first?" (reasonable - not a no)
- "What would I need to commit to?" (negotiating - good sign)

**Bad Responses:**
- "Maybe, let me think about it" (polite no)
- "Let me see what else is out there first" (not urgent enough)
- "I'd need to see it fully built first" (not an early adopter)

## Document Control

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** February 14, 2026
**Purpose:** Customer discovery interview guide
**Next Update:** After first 3-5 interviews (revise based on what works)

**Remember:** The goal is to **learn**, not to **sell**. If you learn this isn't a real problem or people won't pay for it, that's valuable information too. Fail fast and pivot if needed.
