# Expert Consultation Questions - Accountant Meeting

**Context:** Meeting with YOUR accountant to validate the AML compliance opportunity
**Purpose:** Get expert insights on what small-to-medium accounting firms need
**Approach:** Industry expert consultation, not customer discovery

---

## Meeting Framework

**Your Position:**
> "I've been researching the new AML/CTF requirements coming July 1, 2026, and I'm exploring whether there's a business opportunity helping small accounting firms (3-15 staff) automate compliance. I know you're not the target customer yourself, but I'd love to get your professional perspective on what you're seeing in the industry and whether this is a real pain point for smaller firms."

## 10 Expert Consultation Questions

### 1. Industry Landscape & Firm Segments

**Question:**
> "From your perspective in the industry, how are different sized accounting firms approaching AML compliance? Are you seeing a difference between how solo practitioners, small firms (3-10 staff), and medium firms (10-30 staff) are preparing? Who seems most stressed about it?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Industry segmentation insights
- Which segments are most underserved
- Who's struggling vs. who's handling it fine
- Market size validation

**Listen For:**
- "The small firms are really panicking"
- "Medium-sized firms are just hiring compliance staff"
- "Solo practitioners are considering stopping those services"
- Specific firm size ranges that are struggling
- Geographic variations (metro vs. regional)

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What percentage of firms in that size range do designated services regularly?"
- "Are you hearing about firms that are handling this well? What are they doing differently?"
- "Do you think many firms will just drop designated services rather than comply?"

---

### 2. Pain Point Validation from Industry Perspective

**Question:**
> "I've mapped out the compliance workflow - from service determination, through customer due diligence, beneficial ownership identification, PEP screening, ongoing monitoring, to 7-year record retention. Based on your knowledge of how small firms operate, which parts of this workflow do you think would cause the most pain or confusion?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Validation of your workflow research
- Expert opinion on bottlenecks
- Understanding of typical firm capabilities

**Listen For:**
- "Beneficial ownership is going to be a nightmare for them"
- "Most small firms don't have good document management"
- "They won't understand the difference between designated and non-designated services"
- "The ongoing monitoring will get forgotten"
- Specific workflow steps highlighted as problems

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Would most small firms even know how to do PEP screening?"
- "Do they typically have systems for tracking periodic reviews, or is that new?"
- "How good are most small firms at record retention generally?"

---

### 3. Current Solution Awareness

**Question:**
> "Have you heard what solutions firms are considering? Are people talking about the AUSTRAC starter kit, commercial software, or just planning to wing it? What's the buzz in your professional networks?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Market awareness level
- Competitive landscape validation
- Word-of-mouth trends
- Buying behavior patterns

**Listen For:**
- "Most people don't even know the starter kit exists yet"
- "Everyone's waiting to see what CPA/CA ANZ recommends"
- "I've heard of a few firms looking at [specific software]"
- "Most are in denial and haven't started planning"
- Industry event discussions

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Do you think the free AUSTRAC kit will be good enough for most small firms?"
- "What would make a firm choose software over the manual approach?"
- "Are professional bodies (CPA/CA ANZ/IPA) pushing specific solutions?"

---

### 4. Time & Cost Reality Check

**Question:**
> "My research suggests 2-10 hours per client for initial onboarding depending on complexity - does that sound realistic to you? For a firm doing 50 designated service clients per year, that's 100-500 hours of new work. Can small firms absorb that, or is this going to break their business model?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Validation of time estimates
- Reality check on business impact
- Understanding of pricing dynamics

**Listen For:**
- "That sounds about right, maybe even conservative"
- "Small firms can't afford to spend that much time"
- "They'll have to charge more for those services"
- "Some will just outsource AML to consultants"
- Revenue vs. cost dynamics

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Are clients going to accept higher fees for compliance work?"
- "Could this force consolidation - small firms merging or closing?"
- "Will firms hire dedicated compliance staff or just overwork existing people?"

---

### 5. Technology Readiness Assessment

**Question:**
> "How tech-savvy are most small accounting firms these days? Are they using modern practice management systems, cloud software, automation tools? Or are many still pretty old-school with spreadsheets and email? I'm trying to understand if they'd adopt compliance software or if it's too big a leap."

**What You're Seeking:**
- Tech adoption patterns in target market
- UX complexity tolerance
- Integration vs. standalone preference

**Listen For:**
- "Most are on Xero Practice Manager or MYOB these days"
- "You'd be surprised how many still use spreadsheets"
- "The younger firms are tech-savvy, older owners not so much"
- Cloud adoption rates
- Resistance to new systems

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What practice management systems are most common in the 3-15 staff range?"
- "How long does it typically take a small firm to adopt new software?"
- "Would they prefer something integrated with their PM system or standalone?"

---

### 6. Pricing & Budget Reality Check

**Question:**
> "I'm thinking about a pricing model around $200-$700 per month for automation software targeted at small firms - somewhere between the free manual option and $5,000-$50,000 enterprise solutions. Does that pricing range make sense for your typical 5-10 person firm, or am I way off?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Direct pricing validation
- Budget reality check
- Value perception
- Willingness to pay indicators

**Listen For:**
- "That's totally reasonable for a firm doing 50+ designated services"
- "Small firms are really price-sensitive, might be a stretch"
- "They'd pay that if it saves them time and reduces risk"
- "Depends on what it actually does"
- Comparison to other software they buy

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What do firms typically pay for practice management software?"
- "Would they rather pay per client processed or flat monthly fee?"
- "At what price point does it become a partner decision vs. office manager decision?"

---

### 7. Risk Tolerance & Compliance Culture

**Question:**
> "The penalties are severe - up to $37.8 million for serious breaches. Do you think that's enough to scare small firms into taking this seriously and paying for good compliance tools? Or will most just use the free templates and hope for the best?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Risk perception in the industry
- Compliance culture maturity
- Fear vs. cost optimization behavior

**Listen For:**
- "Accountants are generally risk-averse, the penalties will motivate them"
- "Small firms always cut corners on compliance"
- "They'll take it seriously once they see the first AUSTRAC enforcement action"
- "Depends on their client base - high-value clients mean higher risk exposure"

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Have you seen compliance software adoption in other contexts (data breach, tax)?"
- "Would professional indemnity insurers require certain compliance standards?"
- "Will AUSTRAC actually audit small firms or just go after the big ones?"

---

### 8. Market Size & Opportunity Validation

**Question:**
> "Do you have a sense of how many accounting firms in Australia fit the 3-15 staff range and regularly do designated services (company/trust formation, entity sales)? Am I looking at hundreds of potential customers or thousands? Is this a real market or a niche?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- TAM (Total Addressable Market) validation
- Geographic distribution
- Market concentration

**Listen For:**
- Specific numbers or estimates
- "Most firms do some company formations"
- "That's probably 30-40% of all small firms"
- "Regional vs. metro differences"
- Growth trends in advisory services

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Are more firms moving into advisory/entity work or away from it?"
- "Is there geographic concentration (Sydney/Melbourne) or is it national?"
- "What about the 15-30 staff segment - is that a bigger opportunity?"

---

### 9. Go-to-Market Strategy Validation

**Question:**
> "If you were trying to reach small accounting firms with a compliance solution, how would you do it? Would you go through professional associations (CPA/CA ANZ), advertise in accounting publications, use word-of-mouth, partner with practice management software companies? What channels actually work in this industry?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Marketing channel validation
- Partnership opportunities
- Buying decision influences
- Sales cycle insights

**Listen For:**
- "CPA Australia has a huge influence on small firms"
- "Accountants trust peer recommendations above everything"
- "Practice management software vendors would be a great channel"
- "Industry conferences are where people learn about new tools"
- Specific publication/event names

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Do small firm owners typically make software decisions themselves or delegate?"
- "How long is a typical buying cycle for practice software?"
- "Would you need to get endorsed by professional bodies or can you go direct?"

---

### 10. The Harsh Reality Check

**Question:**
> "Be brutally honest with me - am I chasing a real opportunity here, or is this a solution in search of a problem? Could this just be a short-term panic that subsides once firms realize the free templates work fine? What could kill this business idea?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Devil's advocate perspective
- Risk factors you haven't considered
- Reality check on sustainability

**Listen For:**
- "I think there's definitely something here"
- "The problem is real but I'm not sure firms will pay for software"
- "Your timing might be off - too early or too late"
- "The real opportunity might be consulting, not software"
- Alternative business models

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What would need to be true for small firms to actually adopt compliance software?"
- "Is there a risk that AUSTRAC delays or waters down the requirements?"
- "Could professional bodies build this themselves and give it to members?"

## Discussion Topics to Cover

### Beyond the Questions

**1. Competitive Landscape Deep Dive**
- "Have you heard of any startups or software companies working on this?"
- "Who would be natural competitors - the practice management vendors, compliance consultants, someone else?"
- "Could the Big 4 or mid-tier firms launch a product for small firms?"

**2. Feature Prioritization**
Show them your automation opportunities list:
- CDD automation (electronic verification)
- Risk assessment automation
- OCDD reminder system
- Document management/retention
- Workflow enforcement

Ask: "Which 2-3 of these would deliver the most value to a small firm?"

**3. Customer Acquisition Reality**
- "If I wanted to talk to 10 small firm owners in the next month, how would I reach them?"
- "Would you be willing to introduce me to a couple of firms you know?"
- "What would make a firm owner take a 30-minute call with someone building this?"

**4. Business Model Validation**
- "Would firms prefer to buy this software, or would they rather outsource the whole AML function to a service provider?"
- "Is there a role for accounting firms to white-label this and resell to their clients who are also caught by AML (lawyers, real estate agents)?"
- "Could this be a value-added service from professional bodies rather than a separate commercial product?"

**5. Insider Insights**
- "What am I not asking that I should be asking?"
- "What do you think I've gotten wrong in my research?"
- "If you were building this business, what would you do differently?"

## The "Ask" at the End

**If Meeting Goes Well:**
> "This has been incredibly valuable. I think there might be something here. Would you be comfortable introducing me to 2-3 small firm owners you know who might be facing this challenge? I'm not trying to sell them anything either - just validate that what you're describing is real. I'd only need 30 minutes of their time."

**Possible Follow-Up Roles:**
- Advisor (informal or formal advisory board)
- Beta tester (if their firm happens to fit the profile)
- Referral source (ongoing introductions)
- Industry validator (can you reference "accountants I've consulted with" in marketing?)
