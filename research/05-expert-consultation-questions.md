# Expert Consultation Questions - Accountant Meeting

**Context:** Meeting with YOUR accountant to validate the AML compliance opportunity
**Purpose:** Get expert insights on what small-to-medium accounting firms need
**Approach:** Industry expert consultation, not customer discovery

---

## Meeting Framework

**Your Position:**
> "I've been researching the new AML/CTF requirements coming July 1, 2026, and I'm exploring whether there's a business opportunity helping small accounting firms (3-15 staff) automate compliance. I know you're not the target customer yourself, but I'd love to get your professional perspective on what you're seeing in the industry and whether this is a real pain point for smaller firms."

---

## 10 Expert Consultation Questions

### 1. Industry Landscape & Firm Segments

**Question:**
> "From your perspective in the industry, how are different sized accounting firms approaching AML compliance? Are you seeing a difference between how solo practitioners, small firms (3-10 staff), and medium firms (10-30 staff) are preparing? Who seems most stressed about it?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Industry segmentation insights
- Which segments are most underserved
- Who's struggling vs. who's handling it fine
- Market size validation

**Listen For:**
- "The small firms are really panicking"
- "Medium-sized firms are just hiring compliance staff"
- "Solo practitioners are considering stopping those services"
- Specific firm size ranges that are struggling
- Geographic variations (metro vs. regional)

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What percentage of firms in that size range do designated services regularly?"
- "Are you hearing about firms that are handling this well? What are they doing differently?"
- "Do you think many firms will just drop designated services rather than comply?"

---

### 2. Pain Point Validation from Industry Perspective

**Question:**
> "I've mapped out the compliance workflow - from service determination, through customer due diligence, beneficial ownership identification, PEP screening, ongoing monitoring, to 7-year record retention. Based on your knowledge of how small firms operate, which parts of this workflow do you think would cause the most pain or confusion?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Validation of your workflow research
- Expert opinion on bottlenecks
- Understanding of typical firm capabilities

**Listen For:**
- "Beneficial ownership is going to be a nightmare for them"
- "Most small firms don't have good document management"
- "They won't understand the difference between designated and non-designated services"
- "The ongoing monitoring will get forgotten"
- Specific workflow steps highlighted as problems

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Would most small firms even know how to do PEP screening?"
- "Do they typically have systems for tracking periodic reviews, or is that new?"
- "How good are most small firms at record retention generally?"

---

### 3. Current Solution Awareness

**Question:**
> "Have you heard what solutions firms are considering? Are people talking about the AUSTRAC starter kit, commercial software, or just planning to wing it? What's the buzz in your professional networks?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Market awareness level
- Competitive landscape validation
- Word-of-mouth trends
- Buying behavior patterns

**Listen For:**
- "Most people don't even know the starter kit exists yet"
- "Everyone's waiting to see what CPA/CA ANZ recommends"
- "I've heard of a few firms looking at [specific software]"
- "Most are in denial and haven't started planning"
- Industry event discussions

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Do you think the free AUSTRAC kit will be good enough for most small firms?"
- "What would make a firm choose software over the manual approach?"
- "Are professional bodies (CPA/CA ANZ/IPA) pushing specific solutions?"

---

### 4. Time & Cost Reality Check

**Question:**
> "My research suggests 2-10 hours per client for initial onboarding depending on complexity - does that sound realistic to you? For a firm doing 50 designated service clients per year, that's 100-500 hours of new work. Can small firms absorb that, or is this going to break their business model?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Validation of time estimates
- Reality check on business impact
- Understanding of pricing dynamics

**Listen For:**
- "That sounds about right, maybe even conservative"
- "Small firms can't afford to spend that much time"
- "They'll have to charge more for those services"
- "Some will just outsource AML to consultants"
- Revenue vs. cost dynamics

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Are clients going to accept higher fees for compliance work?"
- "Could this force consolidation - small firms merging or closing?"
- "Will firms hire dedicated compliance staff or just overwork existing people?"

---

### 5. Technology Readiness Assessment

**Question:**
> "How tech-savvy are most small accounting firms these days? Are they using modern practice management systems, cloud software, automation tools? Or are many still pretty old-school with spreadsheets and email? I'm trying to understand if they'd adopt compliance software or if it's too big a leap."

**What You're Seeking:**
- Tech adoption patterns in target market
- UX complexity tolerance
- Integration vs. standalone preference

**Listen For:**
- "Most are on Xero Practice Manager or MYOB these days"
- "You'd be surprised how many still use spreadsheets"
- "The younger firms are tech-savvy, older owners not so much"
- Cloud adoption rates
- Resistance to new systems

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What practice management systems are most common in the 3-15 staff range?"
- "How long does it typically take a small firm to adopt new software?"
- "Would they prefer something integrated with their PM system or standalone?"

---

### 6. Pricing & Budget Reality Check

**Question:**
> "I'm thinking about a pricing model around $200-$700 per month for automation software targeted at small firms - somewhere between the free manual option and $5,000-$50,000 enterprise solutions. Does that pricing range make sense for your typical 5-10 person firm, or am I way off?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Direct pricing validation
- Budget reality check
- Value perception
- Willingness to pay indicators

**Listen For:**
- "That's totally reasonable for a firm doing 50+ designated services"
- "Small firms are really price-sensitive, might be a stretch"
- "They'd pay that if it saves them time and reduces risk"
- "Depends on what it actually does"
- Comparison to other software they buy

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What do firms typically pay for practice management software?"
- "Would they rather pay per client processed or flat monthly fee?"
- "At what price point does it become a partner decision vs. office manager decision?"

---

### 7. Risk Tolerance & Compliance Culture

**Question:**
> "The penalties are severe - up to $37.8 million for serious breaches. Do you think that's enough to scare small firms into taking this seriously and paying for good compliance tools? Or will most just use the free templates and hope for the best?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Risk perception in the industry
- Compliance culture maturity
- Fear vs. cost optimization behavior

**Listen For:**
- "Accountants are generally risk-averse, the penalties will motivate them"
- "Small firms always cut corners on compliance"
- "They'll take it seriously once they see the first AUSTRAC enforcement action"
- "Depends on their client base - high-value clients mean higher risk exposure"

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Have you seen compliance software adoption in other contexts (data breach, tax)?"
- "Would professional indemnity insurers require certain compliance standards?"
- "Will AUSTRAC actually audit small firms or just go after the big ones?"

---

### 8. Market Size & Opportunity Validation

**Question:**
> "Do you have a sense of how many accounting firms in Australia fit the 3-15 staff range and regularly do designated services (company/trust formation, entity sales)? Am I looking at hundreds of potential customers or thousands? Is this a real market or a niche?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- TAM (Total Addressable Market) validation
- Geographic distribution
- Market concentration

**Listen For:**
- Specific numbers or estimates
- "Most firms do some company formations"
- "That's probably 30-40% of all small firms"
- "Regional vs. metro differences"
- Growth trends in advisory services

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Are more firms moving into advisory/entity work or away from it?"
- "Is there geographic concentration (Sydney/Melbourne) or is it national?"
- "What about the 15-30 staff segment - is that a bigger opportunity?"

---

### 9. Go-to-Market Strategy Validation

**Question:**
> "If you were trying to reach small accounting firms with a compliance solution, how would you do it? Would you go through professional associations (CPA/CA ANZ), advertise in accounting publications, use word-of-mouth, partner with practice management software companies? What channels actually work in this industry?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Marketing channel validation
- Partnership opportunities
- Buying decision influences
- Sales cycle insights

**Listen For:**
- "CPA Australia has a huge influence on small firms"
- "Accountants trust peer recommendations above everything"
- "Practice management software vendors would be a great channel"
- "Industry conferences are where people learn about new tools"
- Specific publication/event names

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Do small firm owners typically make software decisions themselves or delegate?"
- "How long is a typical buying cycle for practice software?"
- "Would you need to get endorsed by professional bodies or can you go direct?"

---

### 10. The Harsh Reality Check

**Question:**
> "Be brutally honest with me - am I chasing a real opportunity here, or is this a solution in search of a problem? Could this just be a short-term panic that subsides once firms realize the free templates work fine? What could kill this business idea?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Devil's advocate perspective
- Risk factors you haven't considered
- Reality check on sustainability

**Listen For:**
- "I think there's definitely something here"
- "The problem is real but I'm not sure firms will pay for software"
- "Your timing might be off - too early or too late"
- "The real opportunity might be consulting, not software"
- Alternative business models

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What would need to be true for small firms to actually adopt compliance software?"
- "Is there a risk that AUSTRAC delays or waters down the requirements?"
- "Could professional bodies build this themselves and give it to members?"

---

## BONUS: Exploring Other Automation Opportunities

### 11. Beyond AML - What Else Keeps Small Firms Busy?

**Context Setting:**
> "I'm focused on AML compliance right now because of the July 2026 deadline, but I'm curious - what other workflows or processes do you see small accounting firms struggling with? Where are they spending tons of manual time that could be automated? What do you hear people complaining about at industry events?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Other pain points beyond AML
- Adjacent opportunities
- Broader automation needs
- Validation of accounting practice pain points

**Listen For:**

**Common Accounting Workflow Pain Points:**

- "Time tracking and billing"
- "Tax workflow management"
- "Year-end process coordination"
- "Client communication and status updates"

**Specific Opportunity Indicators:**
- Repetitive manual processes
- High-volume, low-value tasks
- Processes that cause client friction
- Compliance-related workflows
- Information gathering bottlenecks
- Communication overhead

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "How much time does a typical firm spend on [that pain point] each month?"
- "Are there existing solutions for that, or is it still mostly manual?"
- "Would firms pay to automate that, or would they just keep doing it manually?"
- "Is that problem specific to small firms or does everyone struggle with it?"

---

### 12. The Client Onboarding Question

**Question:**
> "Even outside of AML, what does client onboarding look like for most small firms? Is it standardized and systematic, or is every firm doing it differently with forms, emails, and spreadsheets? What information do they need to collect, and how painful is that process?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Broader onboarding pain points (AML is just one piece)
- Standardization vs. chaos
- Technology gaps
- Adjacent product opportunities

**Listen For:**
- "Most firms have terrible onboarding processes"
- "Every firm reinvents the wheel with their own Word documents"
- "Client information gets lost in email chains"
- "They collect the same information multiple times"
- "No one has a good system for tracking what's been collected"

**Adjacent Opportunities:**
- General client onboarding automation (AML as feature, not whole product)
- Document collection and portal
- E-signature workflow
- Client information management
- Engagement letter automation
- Know Your Client (KYC) beyond just AML

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What client information do firms typically need to collect at onboarding?"
- "How do they currently manage engagement letters - DocuSign, email, paper?"
- "Do firms struggle with the same client onboarding problems across tax, audit, advisory?"

---

### 13. The Document Management Pain

**Question:**
> "How are most small firms handling document management and retention? Are they on modern DMS platforms, or is it still network drives, Dropbox folders, and hoping they can find things later? What about retention policies - do they actually follow them?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Document management maturity
- Compliance with retention requirements
- Pain severity
- Willingness to pay for better tools

**Listen For:**
- "Document management is chaos at most small firms"
- "They use Dropbox or network drives with terrible folder structures"
- "No one can find anything when clients call"
- "Retention policies? What retention policies?"
- "They spend hours looking for old documents"

**Opportunity Assessment:**
- Is DMS a solved problem (Xero, MYOB, SharePoint) or still painful?
- Would they pay for accounting-specific DMS?
- Is this bundled with other tools or standalone need?

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What percentage of small firms use proper DMS vs. just file shares?"
- "Do the existing practice management systems have good document management?"
- "Would firms pay extra for better document search and organization?"

---

### 14. The Client Communication Overhead

**Question:**
> "How much time do small firms spend on client communication - emails back and forth asking for information, status updates, answering the same questions repeatedly? Is there a 'client portal' problem where firms want better ways to communicate but don't have good tools?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Communication overhead quantification
- Portal adoption and satisfaction
- Automation opportunity
- Client experience pain points

**Listen For:**
- "So much time wasted on email ping-pong"
- "Clients always ask 'where are we at with my tax return?'"

- "Firms need better ways to request documents from clients"
- "Status updates are completely manual"

**Opportunity Types:**
- Client portal / communication platform
- Automated status updates
- Document request automation
- FAQ/self-service for clients
- SMS/WhatsApp integration for client communication

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Do the practice management systems have client portals? Are they any good?"
- "How do most firms request documents - email, portal, paper?"
- "Would clients actually use a portal if it was easy enough?"

---

### 15. The Compliance Treadmill

**Question:**
> "AML is the hot compliance topic right now, but what other compliance burdens are hitting small firms? Data privacy, cybersecurity, professional indemnity requirements? Is there a pattern where compliance keeps piling up but tools to manage it don't keep pace?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Other compliance pain points
- Pattern of regulatory burden
- Willingness to pay for compliance tools
- Market timing for other compliance opportunities

**Listen For:**
- "Privacy laws (Australian Privacy Principles) are a nightmare"
- "Cybersecurity requirements from clients and insurers are increasing"
- "Professional indemnity insurers want evidence of compliance"
- "Tax compliance is getting more complex every year"
- "Every new regulation adds overhead but no one builds tools for small firms"

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Is there a "compliance tool platform" opportunity?
- Could you build a compliance management suite (AML + privacy + security)?
- Is compliance a category where small firms will pay?

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "What compliance requirements cause the most overhead after AML?"
- "Do firms have good systems for demonstrating compliance to insurers/regulators?"
- "Would a 'compliance dashboard' showing all obligations be valuable?"

---

### 16. The Pricing and Scoping Problem

**Question:**
> "How do small firms handle pricing and scoping for new engagements? Is it standardized, or is every quote custom? Do they struggle to estimate time and price profitably? Is there a 'quoting tool' gap?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Pricing sophistication
- Scope creep problems
- Opportunity for pricing/quoting tools
- Time tracking and profitability visibility

**Listen For:**
- "Most firms underprice because they guess wrong on time"
- "Scope creep kills profitability"
- "No good tools for building quotes quickly"
- "Pricing is inconsistent - depends who the client talks to"
- "They don't track actual time vs. estimated, so they never learn"

**Opportunity Assessment:**
- Quote/proposal automation
- Pricing calculator based on historical data
- Scope management and change orders
- Profitability analytics

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Do practice management systems have good quoting tools built in?"
- "How do firms price advisory work vs. compliance work?"
- "Would firms pay for AI-powered time estimation based on similar jobs?"

---

### 17. The "What Would You Build?" Question

**Question:**
> "If you could wave a magic wand and automate one painful workflow for small accounting firms - something where the current solutions are inadequate or too expensive - what would it be? What's the number one thing that wastes time or causes stress that someone should solve?"

**What You're Seeking:**
- Expert opinion on highest-value opportunity
- Validation of AML vs. other opportunities
- Creative ideas you haven't considered
- Priority ranking

**Listen For:**
- Their top-of-mind answer (reveals what's most painful)
- "Actually, I think AML is probably the most urgent..."
- "Honestly, client onboarding in general is the bigger problem"
- "If someone solved [X], they'd have a huge market"
- Specific, detailed pain point descriptions

**This Reveals:**
- Whether AML is the right focus or just one of many opportunities
- What adjacent markets might be bigger
- What experts think is the most valuable problem to solve

**Follow-Up Probes:**
- "Why hasn't someone built that already?"
- "How much would a firm pay per month for that solution?"
- "Is that problem getting better or worse over time?"

---

## How to Weave This Into Your Meeting

### Timing (Last 15-20 Minutes)

After you've covered the AML-specific questions:

> "I really appreciate all the AML insights. Before we wrap up, I want to zoom out a bit. AML is clearly a compliance requirement hitting firms in July 2026, but I'm curious about the broader landscape of pain points for small firms..."

Then transition into questions 11-17.

### Why This Matters

**Validates Your Current Focus:**
- If they say "AML is definitely the most urgent thing" → you're on the right track
- If they say "Honestly, [other thing] is a way bigger problem" → valuable pivot signal

**Uncovers Adjacent Opportunities:**
- AML might be a feature, not a product (part of broader onboarding)
- Could inform your roadmap (solve AML first, then expand)
- Might reveal a better initial opportunity

**Market Sizing:**
- Is AML a $X million opportunity but client onboarding is $XX million?
- Should you go narrow (AML only) or broader (compliance platform)?

**Product Strategy:**
- Should you build AML-specific tool or general workflow automation?
- Is there a larger platform play with AML as wedge?

---

## What Great Answers Look Like

### Strong Signal Examples

**For AML Being Right Focus:**
- "AML is the most urgent because there's a hard deadline and big penalties"
- "Everything else is chronic pain, but AML is acute pain about to hit"
- "Firms will pay for AML because they have to; other stuff is nice-to-have"

**For Pivoting/Expanding:**
- "Client onboarding is painful every day; AML is just one piece of that"
- "If you solve AML plus [X] and [Y], you'd have a complete solution"
- "The real money is in [different opportunity], AML is too niche"

**For Adjacent Expansion:**
- "Start with AML to get in the door, then expand to [X]"
- "AML is a wedge; the bigger opportunity is [compliance platform/onboarding platform/etc.]"
- "Firms would pay more if it also solved [related problem]"

---

## Post-Meeting Analysis

### After the Meeting, Ask Yourself:

1. **Focus Validation:**
   - Did they confirm AML is the most urgent/valuable opportunity?
   - Or did they suggest something else is more important?

2. **Market Size Comparison:**
   - Is the AML market bigger or smaller than other opportunities they mentioned?
   - Which problems affect more firms more often?

3. **Willingness to Pay:**
   - Which problems would firms pay more for?
   - Is AML compliance a "must-have" but other things are "nice-to-have"?

4. **Competition Assessment:**
   - Are the other opportunities they mentioned less competitive?
   - Is there a greenfield opportunity you hadn't considered?

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - ✅ **Stay focused on AML** (if validated as best opportunity)
   - 🔄 **Expand scope** (AML + onboarding + document management = platform)
   - 🔀 **Pivot** (if something else is clearly better opportunity)
   - 📋 **Roadmap planning** (AML first, then expand to X, Y, Z)

## Discussion Topics to Cover

### Beyond the Questions

**1. Competitive Landscape Deep Dive**
- "Have you heard of any startups or software companies working on this?"
- "Who would be natural competitors - the practice management vendors, compliance consultants, someone else?"

- "Would you be willing to introduce me to a couple of firms you know?"
- "What would make a firm owner take a 30-minute call with someone building this?"

**4. Business Model Validation**
- "Would firms prefer to buy this software, or would they rather outsource the whole AML function to a service provider?"
- "Is there a role for accounting firms to white-label this and resell to their clients who are also caught by AML (lawyers, real estate agents)?"
- "Could this be a value-added service from professional bodies rather than a separate commercial product?"

**5. Insider Insights**
- "What am I not asking that I should be asking?"
- "What do you think I've gotten wrong in my research?"

## Key Differences from Customer Discovery

**This Meeting:**
- ✅ Expert consultant perspective
- ✅ Industry-wide insights
- ✅ Market validation
- ✅ Referrals to actual prospects
- ✅ Strategic guidance

**NOT This Meeting:**
- ❌ Not trying to sell them anything
- ❌ Not asking them to be a customer
- ❌ Not getting their specific pain points (they don't have this problem)
- ❌ Not doing detailed workflow analysis of their firm

**Your Accountant's Value:**
- They understand the industry dynamics
- They know what small firms struggle with
- They can introduce you to prospects
- They can validate (or invalidate) your assumptions
- They might spot opportunities or risks you've missed

---

## The "Ask" at the End

**If Meeting Goes Well:**
> "This has been incredibly valuable. I think there might be something here. Would you be comfortable introducing me to 2-3 small firm owners you know who might be facing this challenge? I'm not trying to sell them anything either - just validate that what you're describing is real. I'd only need 30 minutes of their time."

**Possible Follow-Up Roles:**
- Advisor (informal or formal advisory board)
- Beta tester (if their firm happens to fit the profile)
- Referral source (ongoing introductions)
- Industry validator (can you reference "accountants I've consulted with" in marketing?)

---

## Document Control

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** February 14, 2026
**Purpose:** Expert consultation meeting guide (YOUR accountant, not a prospect)
**Context:** Industry validation, not customer discovery

**Remember:** This is a learning conversation with a trusted expert. Be open to hearing that your idea needs refinement - or that it's not viable. That's valuable information too.
